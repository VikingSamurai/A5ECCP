# Suggested Houserules

## Character Generation boost
Standard 27-point point buy. Additionally, free ASI and feat at level 1, with the proviso that none of your stats can go above 18 at chargen

## Ability Score Increases
ASIs are on a character basis and not a class basis. Classes that give ASIs at nonstandard level, such as Cavalier at level 10, are exempt for those nonstandard features.

## Multiclass extra attack
You can attack twice when the sum of your two classes which have access to extra attack is equal to or greater than 5. If you have a class that has extra attack and a class with an archetype that gets extra attack at level 6, you get extra attack at level 6.

Fighter/Marshal: you can attack 3 times when the sum of your fighter and marshal levels are 11 or greater

## Luck Dice
Luck dice rules used, as per https://www.questgivers.com/product.php?p=20

## Initiative
Natural 20 rolls get to pick where they are on the initiative order after everyone else has rolled.

## Potions
Drinking a potion yourself is a bonus action. Drinking a potion yourself as an action maximises any dice rolled as part of the potion. Administering a potion to someone else is an action.

## Inspiration
Inspiration can now be used to reroll a failed d20 roll or give advantage before the roll.

## Wounds
Bruised 75%, Bloodied 50%, Badly Wounded 25%.

## Being downed
Being downed and then brought back to 0hp gives a level of fatigue which applies after the fight concludes

## Death Saves
Death saves are rolled in secret

## Spellcasting with no slots
If a magic user is out of spell slots but REALLY needs to cast a spell, they can push themselves past their limits and continue to cast spells, take a level of strife each time they do. The maximum spell level they can do this for is the half-highest spell level the character can cast (rounded down)

## Attunement
You can attune a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus. Some magic items may now cost more than one attunement slot to attune to at the Narrator's discretion

## Counterspelling
If you counterspell a counterspell, both/all creatures involved roll on the wild magic surge table.

## Holding Action (spells)
You may hold a spell normally as a readied action (which requires concentration), but you may continue to hold it without expending additional spell slots by spending your action each turn to do so. During this action, you may change what triggers you to release the spell.

## Longer Bonus Actions
Longer Bonus Actions: If a spell, feature, or other activity can normally be done as a bonus action, you may choose to do it as an action instead. You can't do this to use the same type of activity twice in the same turn

## Readily Available Items
It takes an action to find and retrieve a desired item from within your backpack, bag of holding, sack, or other closed container.

Some containers make their contents readily available, so that withdrawing a desired item can be done as a simple item interaction. These include:
- Scabbards, sheathes, holsters, and similar unsecured item containers.
- Potion bandoleers, belts, and pouches.
- Heward's handy haversack

Spell component pouches are a special case. Any number of components for spells can be freely withdrawn or stowed during the casting of those spells.

\page

## Fleeing Combat
At initiative count 0, one side of a combat may choose to flee. If the other side wants to prevent them, then a chase scene begins. The idea is this means fleeing becomes a practical option.


## Using Spell Scrolls
Any caster can attempt to use a spell scroll of a level they can cast even if it's not on their list provided they pass an arcana, nature or religion check of DC 10+spell level. Which check the spell is depends on the traditions to which the spell is available and is up to Narrator discretion.

## Casting spells as a reaction on your own turn
Unless specifically stated that you can use a reaction to cast a spell, as per a class feature or for example the sub-effect of the spell Counterspell, you may not cast a spell with a casting time of 1 reaction on your own turn.

## Legendary actions: "Break Bars"
In this variant, a Narrator telegraphs what a legendary action they're going to use is on the legendary monster's turn. Failed saves or contested skill checks between now and when the legendary action would be taken have the ability to interrupt the legendary action (and only the legendary action). This provides players the ability to use features that ordinarily a boss might be immune to or just ignore in order to disrupt its action economy. 

For example, someone might use a stun effect to disrupt the legendary action of a boss that would ordinarily be immune to stun for balance reasons.

This rule is apparently very good at incentivising smart maneuver use, like well-placed shoves, and has the side effect of consuming enough of the party's own action economy trying to disrupt the boss' that big boss fights might nevertheless have a little more staying power as it's no longer just a race to 0HP.

# Classes

# Arcanist
As a swarm of fiery elementals approaches an
elven woman, she raises her hand summoning
a blazing ball of fire above her. The woman
closes her eyes and focuses as the ball of fire
shifts into a confluence of ice and water. With
just seconds to spare, she swiftly shapes the
ball of ice into a cone-shaped blast aimed at the
elementals which evaporate in a hail of icy shards and
freezing air.

A dwarven adventurer looks in horror as his companion
falls unconscious off a cliff, having been struck by a mortal
blow. Rushing to the edge, in one fluid cast, the dwarf causes
his ally to slow in his fall and be wrapped in a shield of
protective energy for good measure.

A human scholar pores over his notes about thunderclap
and lightning bolt. Suddenly realizing something he hadn't
before, the scholar jumps to his feet, summons his magical
power, and successfully invokes a sphere of exploding bolts
around him. Now all he needed was a name for his newly
invented spell.

All these spellcasters are arcanists, mages with an inherent
connection to and intuition for magic, supplemented by
intense study of their powers. These heroes are exceptionally
skilled at tuning their magic to the situation at hand, tweaking
spells and blending new magical combinations to tackle any
challenge.

### Arcane Intuition
Arcanists are born with an innate connection to magic, much
like a sorcerer, granting them the inherent ability to produce
magical spells. However, like wizards, arcanists take a
structured, academic approach to the understanding of their
magical power. Through their studies and experiences,
arcanists develop a powerful intuition regarding the
mechanics of magic. This comprehension of the
underpinnings of magic grants arcanists greater control over
their spells, allowing them to twist one spell to be more like
another or even combine two spells together.

### Versatile Magic
Combining their strengths, an arcanist's inherent connection
to the arcane and their academic understanding of magic
allow them to utilize their magical powers in surprising and
novel ways. Expert arcanists are unmatched in their
spontaneous magical versatility and their ability to produce
new, unique spells. An arcanist is rarely caught off guard, able
to use each one of their spells to overcome a myriad of
challenges.

Arcanists frequently set out on adventure to seek out
greater knowledge and understanding of their magical
power. In an adventuring party, arcanists serve as a
powerful source of adaptable magic, able to tailor their
spells to each challenge the group faces.

### Creating an Arcanist
When you create your arcanist, consider two questions in
parallel. First, where did you get your magical powers from?
Were you blessed by some powerful being, or maybe magical
power flows through your bloodline? Second, what did you do
to study and master your arcane power? Did you join a
college of wizards, learning to see your magic in an academic
light? Or perhaps you immersed yourself in a study of gods
and other powerful beings to try and discern the source of
your power? In any case, consider the relationship between
your magical abilities and your efforts to study and
understand them.

Arcanists are known for their ability to tune spells to their
liking and often have preferences for certain types of
spells/magics. Look ahead at the branches of study you will
choose from at 2nd level. Are you particularly dedicated to
one school of magic or a few select spells? Maybe you have a
vested interest in the magic surrounding the soul and the
boundary between life and death? Or are you dedicated to a
divine being or fiend who plays some role in your powers?

Lastly, consider your purpose in setting off on adventure.
Are you seeking experience to grow your arcane power and
gain greater expertise in spellcasting? Or, maybe you are
curious about the origins of your magic and are seeking
answers that cannot be found in a library. Perhaps some
tragedy befell you or a loved one and you are trying to
understand the cause?

#### Quick Build
You can make an arcanist quickly by following these
suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability
score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose
the sage background. Third, choose the firebolt, gust, light,
and thunderclap cantrips along with the
1st-level spells mage armor and
burning hands.

#### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**: To qualify for multiclassing with the Arcanist
class, you must meet these prerequisites: 13 Intelligence.
<br>
**Proficiencies**: When you multiclass into the Arcanist class,
you gain no proficiencies.
<br>
**Spell Slots**: You add all your arcanist levels for the purposes of
determining multiclass spell slots.

#### Equipment
You begin the game with 100 gold which youcan spend on your character's starting weapons, armor, and adventuring gear. You can select your own gear or choose one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested Equipment section of your chosen background

- **Arcane Investigator's Set** (Cost 81 gold): Dagger, backpack, 4 candles, chalk, clothes (common), component pouch, spellbook, 2 vials
- **Mage Scholar's Set** (Cost 89 gold): Quarterstaff, abacus, clothes (fine), ink (1-ounce bottle), ink pen, orb arcane focus, 10 sheets of parchment, sack, spellbook
- **Travelling Mage's Set** (Cost 86 gold): Quarterstaff, backpack, bedroll, clothes (traveler’s), component pouch, flask of oil, lantern (hooded), mess tin, spellbook

### Spellcasting
Beginning at 1st level, your intuitive understanding of magic allows you to produce spells through your connection to the arcane.
#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the
arcanist spell list. You learn additional arcanist cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column of the Arcanist table.
\page
#### Spell Slots
The Arcanist table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
arcanist spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the arcanist
spell list. The Spells Known column of the Arcanist table
shows when you learn more arcanist spells of your choice
from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots on the arcanist table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the arcanist spells you know from this feature
and replace it with another spell from the arcanist spell list.
The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell
slots on the Arcanist table.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arcanist
spells. You use your intelligence whenever a spell refers to
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your intelligence
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a intelligence
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align:center">

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting
focus for your arcanist spells.

### Tweak Spell
At 1st level, you begin learning how to subtly alter your spells
to be like others in your repertoire. When you cast a spell or
cantrip you may choose to apply one of the following options:

- You change one of the damage types of your spell to a
damage type from another arcanist spell/cantrip you
know.
- You change the range of your spell to match the range of
another arcanist spell/cantrip you know.
- You change the area of your spell to match the area of
another arcanist spell/cantrip you know. The spell you are
tweaking must already have an area to use this option.
- You can change the type of saving throw involved in your
spell to a saving throw from another arcanist spell/cantrip
you know (e.g. you change the dexterity saving throw
from fireball to the charisma saving throw from
banishment).

You may do this a number of times equal to your
intelligence modifier before completing a long or short rest.
You may apply multiple options to a single spell, but each
selected option requires expending one use of this feature.

### Branch of Study
At 2nd level, you specialize your magical exploration into a
particular branch of study, representing the approach you
take towards understanding your arcane power. The branch
you choose grants you features at levels 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18.

In addition, you gain spells according to your chosen
branch at the appropriate arcanist levels. Each of these spells
counts as an arcanist spell for you and does not count against
the number of arcanist
spells you know.

### Spell Blending
Beginning at 3rd level, extensive study of your arcane power
has granted you the knowledge needed to blend your spells in
unique combinations. On your turn, you may use your action
to cast two spells as if they were one. Both spells must have a
casting time of one action, bonus action, or reaction, and only
one of the spells can be a cantrip. The two spells used in the
blended spell are referred to as "component spells" in the
following paragraphs.

A blended spell counts has a level equal to the combined
level of both component spells. If one of the component spells
is a cantrip, the blended spell level equals the level of the
other spell plus one. Casting a blended spell requires
expending a spell slot of a level equal to or greater than the
spell's level, in place of spell slots for each component spell.

A blended spell counts as casting one spell with the effects
of both component spells. You choose the targets or areas of
each component spell separately based on the normal ranges
and targets of each component spell, and each retains its
normal duration. In addition, you choose which component
spell's effects occur first, if the order matters. Both
component spells may require concentration, in which case
both effects end if you lose concentration. Lastly, when you
use the "tweak spell" feature to modify a blended spell, you
may modify one or both of the component spell's effects.

As you gain arcanist levels, you gain further ways to blend
the effects of your spells:

- **Damage Type:** At 5th level, when you blend two spells
that deal damage, you may choose to change the damage
type(s) of one of the component spells to match a damage
type of the other.
- **Range**: At 9th level, you may change the range of one of
your component spells to match the range of the other.

\page

- **Targets/Area**: At 13th level, you may change the
targets/area of one of your component spells to match the
targets/area of the other. If this causes a spell that
normally affects one target to affect multiple targets or
gain an area of effect, the level of the blended spell
increases by one.
- **Hit/Save**: At 17th level, you may replace the attack roll or
saving throw required by one of your component spells
with an attack roll or saving throw involved with the other
component spell. 

If you replace a saving throw with an attack roll, the
level of the blended spell increases by one, with one
exception: If the original spell dealt half damage on a
successful saving throw, the effect now deals full damage
on a hit and no damage on a miss, and the blended spell's
level does not increase by one.

### Scholarly Excellence
At 3rd level, you have a particular set of skills that sets you a cut above a novice mage. Choose one of the following:

#### Academic
You’ve got a whole lot of book smarts. You gain 4 specialties from Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, and Religion. Unlike normal, academic specialties may be taken twice (increasing the specialty’s expertise die to 1d6).

In addition, when you use either Deception or Persuasion to make a point related to an academic specialty, you gain your expertise die from the specialty and use Intelligence for your ability check.
#### Ritual Efficiency
When you cast a spell as a ritual, you only add 1 minute to the casting time (instead of 10 minutes)
#### Rote Memorization
Choose one cantrip which has a casting time of 1 action and doesn’t deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus action without any seen or material components a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest , and can switch the cantrip associated with this feature each time you gain a wizard level

### Hybrid Studies
Your study of magic has uncovered unique ways to explore the world. At 4th level you gain one hybrid study of your choice. Hybrid studies are detailed at the end of the class description. The Studies Known column of the Arcanist table shows when you learn more hybrid studies. Unless otherwise noted, you can gain each study only once.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20
using this feature.

You can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Arcane Consolidation
At 6th level, you learn to consolidate bits of your magical
energy to produce more powerful spells. As a bonus action,
you can sacrifice multiple low level spell slots to create one
spell slot of a higher level. The level of the new spell slot
equals the combined levels of each sacrificed slot.

The level of the spell slots you can sacrifice and create
depend on your arcanist level

- 6th Level: Sacrifice 1st level slots. Create up to 3rd level.
- 10th Level: Sacrifice up to 2nd level. Create up to 5th level.
- 14th Level: Sacrifice up to 3rd level. Create up to 6th level.
- 18th Level: Sacrifice up to 4th level. Create up to 7th level.

### Spell Study
At 7th level, you learn to hone your magic and spells to new power levels thanks to your dedicated studies. Choose one Spell Study that reflects what you have dedicated your arcane studies to. 
#### Arcane Objects
When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when hit by it, you are immediately aware that it’s magical. If you hold such an item in your hand, you can cast identify on it as an action without spending a spell slot, even if you don’t have the spell prepared. 

In addition, when you cast identify using a spell slot or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is cursed , and the Narrator will give you a hint as to the curse’s effects (which may be cryptic and vague, but must not be a lie).
#### Detective Spell Study
You are adept at sensing magic and its effects. If there are active magical effects near you, such as a spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, you automatically sense its presence. You don’t know what spell effects there are or where they are, but you can automatically sense the effect of magic in a 20-foot radius around you. 
\page
In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add detect magic and detect thoughts to your spellbook if they weren’t already there. Whenever you cast detect magic , the range that you can sense magic is increased to 60 feet. Whenever you cast detect thoughts , the range of creatures that you can read thoughts from is increased to 60 feet.
#### Fauna and Flora
Your research into plants, wildlife, and the natural workings of magic grants you superior insights into the magic of living creatures and flora. When a plant or beast makes a saving throw against a spell that you cast, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

### Spell Writer
At 9th level, you work out the kinks and inefficiencies in one
of your favorite blended spells, writing a whole new spell that
you give a name.

Choose a blended spell that you can cast using the spell
blending feature, including any blended damage types,
ranges, targets/areas, and hits/saves. That specific blended
spell's level is one lower than the original blended spell's level
for you. The spell must be 3rd level or lower after the level
reduction.

This new spell counts as an arcanist spell and is added to
your spell list. It does not count against your number of
arcanist spells known. Lastly, you choose the new spell's
school of magic from one of the component spells' schools.

- At level 13, you create another spell up to 5th level.

- At level 17, you create another spell up to 7th level.

<div class = "descriptive">
	<h5>Spell Writer and New Blending Options</h5>
	
When you gain a new option for blending spells ("targets/area"
at 13th level and "hit/save" at 17th level), you may
retroactively apply the new option to your previously invented
spells. However, you must choose to do so as soon as you
gain the new option and you cannot undo your choice once
made.
	
In addition, the spell must still follow its maximum level
restriction after any change (e.g. if your first written spell was
already 3rd level, you can not increase its level to 4 when you
change its targets/area or hit/save)
</div>

### Arcane Appropriation
When you use a magic item, you ignore any requirements related to class, culture, heritage, or level.

### Arcane Defenses
At 15th level, your training has granted you certain protections against magic. Choose one of the following:

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

#### Mental Discipline
Your mind is sheltered from intrusion. When you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw , you can choose to succeed instead. You can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Mystic Mantle
Magic layers upon you into a defensive ward that you can extend to even protect your allies. You and creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to the damage of spells.

#### Superior Countermagic
When you make an ability check as part of casting counterspell or dispel magic , you add your proficiency bonus to the roll. 

In addition, when you cast one of these spells, treat the spell slot level of the spell as one level higher than the actual slot you spent. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at least 3rd-level.

### Arcane Supremacy
Beginning at 20th level, you are exceptionally skilled at the
spells you have written. You may cast each of your written
spells (from the spell writer feature) once without expending
a spell slot. After casting a spell in this manner, you can not
do so again until you finish a long rest

### Hybrid Studies
#### Air Lift
You can use an action to increase your vertical jump distance to 15 feet until the end of your turn. When you jump in this way, you can also glide with the updraft, allowing you to move 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you descend vertically.
#### Detect Magic Savant
*Prerequisite: Able to cast detect magic*

Whenever you cast detect magic, you can choose one of the following benefits to amplify the spell.

**Lengthened Detect Magic**: The duration of detect magic is increased by 10 minutes.

**Extended Detect Magic**: The detection radius of detect magic is increased by 30 feet.

**Penetrating Detect Magic**: The spell can penetrate most barriers, and it is only blocked by 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of common metal, a 1-inch sheet of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt.

#### Eidetic Memory
Your memory is nearly perfect. You can accurately recall anything you’ve read or seen in the past month. Additionally, when retreading a travel route you’ve traveled in the past month, you have advantage on ability checks made against environmental hazards on that route, unless the landscape has been significantly altered in that time.

\page

#### Illusion Detective
*Prerequisite: At least one illusion spell in your spellbook.*

You have advantage on Investigation checks and Intelligence saving throws made against illusion. When you succeed on an ability check or saving throw to see through an illusion, all allies within 30 feet of you gain advantage on checks to see through that illusion for the next minute.

#### Lingering Touch
When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair, bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. If you are carrying the shed piece and attuned to it when you see the creature from which it originated, you immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at which point the attunement ends. At the Narrator’s discretion, you may learn additional cryptic information from being attuned to such things.


#### Loremaster of Creatures
You are well-studied on naturally occurring creatures of the world. When you choose this study, choose one creature type: beasts, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, oozes, plants, or undead. This creature type becomes your Loremaster Creature Specialty. When you encounter a creature of the same type as your Loremaster Creature Specialty, you automatically know any history, legends, or myths related to it. 

#### Mage Hunter (Arcanist)
When tracking a creature that can cast at least 1 spell, you can attempt to do so by focusing on the mystic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use your Intelligence for any ability checks made to track it.

#### Magnetic Step
You can move along vertical surfaces at half your Speed without needing to make an ability check. If you end your turn on such a surface, you immediately fall unless you have some other way to support yourself.

#### Ominous Insight
When you know, you know, you know? When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can attempt to draw on your magics to find an answer and reroll the check. On a failure, your attempt clouds your mind and you have disadvantage on Intelligence checks until you finish a short rest . While suffering this disadvantage, you can’t use Ominous Insight again.

#### Persistent Mending
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast mending*

When you finish a long rest , choose up to 6 creatures who rested with you, including yourself. Choose one piece of their equipment to enchant with a persistent mending effect. The chosen item instantly fixes itself if it becomes damaged. If you choose an item from the following list, it also grants an additional benefit. This effect lasts for 12 hours.

**Coat**: Choose either hot or cold weather. The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to resist the effect of that kind of weather.

**Goggles**: The creature’s vision can never be reduced to less than 20 feet due to inclement weather.

**Shoes**: The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to undertake a forced march.

#### Presto Prestidigitation
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast prestidigitation*

If you are not actively casting prestidigitation or concentrating on a spell, the magic of prestidigitation is always keeping you, your clothes, and your gear sparkling clean.

The following effects are added to the list of options you can choose from when you cast prestidigitation.

- You transmute a small piece of string in your hands into a sturdy 30-foot long rope. For the duration, it functions as a regular hempen rope.
- Using the heads side of a coin like a lens, you can hold the coin over one of your closed eyes and see through it. While looking through the coin in this way, you gain darkvision to a range of 30 feet. The coin’s darkvision effect ends when the spell ends.
- A pebble you touch becomes a sensor that you can use to see through. For the duration as long as you are within 10 feet of the pebble, you can use an action to see through the pebble to a range of 30 feet. While seeing through the pebble, you are blinded and deafened with regard to your own senses.
- On a piece of parchment or paper, you can create an exact copy of another piece of parchment or paper, including any writing, drawings, or other markings that appear on the original. The paper does not change size to accommodate any differences in size between the two. The copy you create lasts for the duration of this spell, and disappears when the spell ends.

#### Retrace
By spending 1 minute in meditation, you can reflect on the magical aura you leave behind as you travel. After doing so, you can perfectly retrace the steps you’ve taken in the past 4 hours.

#### Wode Sense
While traveling, any time you enter an illusory terrain or magic is used to cause you to become lost, you always notice within 1 minute of being affected.

## Branches of Study
While all arcanists seek to understand the mechanics behind
their magical ability, they often choose to do so in different
ways. These unique approaches are represented by the
following branches of study. Within each branch, arcanists
develop different specialties in terms of magical abilities they
develop and particular spells they master.

{{classTable,decoration,frame
##### Branches of Study
| Branch 					  | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------:|
| Arcane Savant     | Specialist in a school|
| Divine Scholar    | Specialist of Divine spellcasting|
| Elementalist      | Specialist of the Elements|
| Occultist         | Specialist in Occult/Warlock spellcasting|
| Spell Specialist  | Specialist in specific spells|
| Twilight Sage     | Specialist in Life and Death|
}}

## Arcane Savant
Some arcanists are born with a natural connection to a
particular school of magic. These arcanists, known as arcane
savants, often focus their studies and practice on that school
to develop mastery over that subset of magic.

Arcane savants are frequently leading magical experts on
their specialized school, acting as authorities on the
knowledge surrounding applications for and the properties of
that school's spells.

### Arcane Savant Spells
At 2nd level, when you select this branch of study, choose one
of the following schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration,
Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,
or Transmutation. The chosen school becomes your
"specialty school", which affects the features granted by the
arcane savant branch of study.

You learn extra spells from your specialty school, as shown
in the following chart. These spells can come from any spell
list.

| Arcanist Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2nd             | Two 1st Level Spells from your Specialty School   |
| 3rd             | Two 2st Level Spells from your Specialty School   |
| 5th             | Two 3rd Level Spells from your Specialty School   |
| 7th             | Two 4th Level Spells from your Specialty School   |
| 9th             | Two 5th Level Spells from your Specialty School   |


### Preferred Magic
Beginning at 2nd level, you have a strong inclination towards
spells from your specialty school, making it easier to copy
their attributes into your other spells.

When you use the tweak spell feature to copy a property
from a spell that is part of your specialty school, you do not
expend a use of tweak spell.

### School Recognition
Beginning at 6th level, your familiarity with your specialty
school becomes sufficiently strong that you effortlessly
recognize related spells and effects.

When you observe or are
affected by a spell or effect from your specialty school, you
immediately know the name and level of the spell and its
effects.


### Intuitive Blending
Beginning at 10th level, blending spells from your specialty
school becomes second nature to you, making it less taxing
to perform.

When you use the spell blending feature and one or both of
the component spells come from your specialty school, you
regain an expended spell slot up to half the level of the
blended spell (rounded down).

### Know your Weaknesses
Beginning at 14th level, your awareness of the
weaknesses and limitations of spells in your specialty
school allows you to more easily avoid and resist their
effects. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws to resist the
effects of spells from your specialty school.
- Creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls to
hit you with spells from your specialty school.

### Second Passion
By 18th level, you have expanded your expertise and
picked up another focus for your arcane power. Choose a
second specialty school. You gain the benefits of the
"preferred magic", "school recognition", "intuitive
blending", and "know your weaknesses" features for the
new school.

## Divine Scholar
While most arcanists take a purely academic approach to
mastering their magic, divine scholars combine a studious
investigation of the divine with their secular understanding.

A divine scholar may have received their magical power
from the gods or simply choose to call upon greater powers
to be blessed with their knowledge. In any case, due to their
expertise in both the divine powers and arcane academia,
divine scholars are often found serving as magic experts for
religious groups or as theologians for wizard schools.

\page

### Divine Scholar Spells
| Arcanist Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2nd             | Bless, Healing Word   |
| 3rd             | Borrowed Knowledge, Lesser Restoration   |
| 5th             | Beacon of Hope, Revivify   |
| 7th             | Divination, Guardian of Faith   |
| 9th             | Commune, Greater Restoration   |

### Holy Magic
Beginning at 2nd level, you can beseech the divine to channel
their powers in your magic. When your spellcasting feature
lets you learn an arcanist spell, you can choose the new spell
from the cleric spell list or the arcanist spell list. These are
arcanist spells for you.


In addition, when you cast a spell that targets one or more
creatures, you may choose to restore a number of hitpoints to
those creatures equal to the spell slot expended to cast the
spell. However, if a creature is at 0 hit points, this grants them
one automatic success on a death saving throw instead of
restoring hit points.

### Divine Guidance
Beginning at 6th level, you can call upon guidance from the
heavens to support you and your allies. Once per short
rest, when a creature you can see within 30 feet
(including yourself) fails an ability check, you can use your
reaction to add 2d4 to their total, possibly changing the
outcome.

### Miraculous Healing
At 10th level, you have developed a connection with the divine
and have been blessed with a supernatural ability to heal
others. Once per long rest, as a bonus action, you can touch a
creature and bless them with rapid healing. For the next
minute, at the beginning of each of that creature's turns,
they regain Xd4 hit points, where X is half your arcanist
level (rounded down).

In addition, at the end of the one minute duration,
the creature is no longer blinded, deafened, paralyzed,
or poisoned, and is cured of disease.


### Divine Knowledge
Beginning at 14th level, you are an expert at petitioning
chosen deities for knowledge. You gain the following benefits:

- When you cast the borrowed knowledge spell, you gain
proficiency in a second chosen skill for the duration of the
spell.
- When you cast the divination spell, you may ask a second
question after receiving your answer to the first as part of
the same spell.
- When you cast the commune spell, you may ask questions
that cannot be answered with a yes or no. Like the
divination spell, answers are generally given as short
phrases, cryptic rhymes, or omens.

### Word of the Gods
Beginning at 18th level, your spells are imbued with ultimate
divine knowledge originating from the creation of life.

Whenever a creature fails a saving throw to resist one of
your spells, you may choose to additionally afflict them with
the effects of the divine word spell. When cast this
way, the divine word spell does not force
celestials, elementals, fey, or fiends
back to their plane of
origin.

## Elementalist
An elementalist seeks to understand the chaotic nature of the elemental planes. As their comprehension grows, elementalists learn to attune to each of the elemental planes and gain abilities associated with that element. The strongest elementalists can attune to all four planes at once, calling upon the powers of all the elements at will.

### Elemental Attunement
At 2nd level, you learn to attune yourself to the elemental
planes, gaining the strengths of different elements as each
situation requires. Once per short rest, as a bonus action, you
can switch your elemental attunement to either air, earth, fire,
or water. Each of these elements grants you different benefits
as you gain arcanist levels.

You may change the damage of a spell to the associated
damage type of the element you are currently attuned to,
without expending a use of tweak spell. The damage types
associated with each element are as follows


- Lightning - Air Attunement
- Acid - Earth Attunement
- Fire - Fire Attunement
- Cold - Water Attunement

### Elementalist Spells
Depending on your current elemental attunement, you gain
access to some of the following spells. When you switch
attunements, you lose any spells gained from the previous
element you were attuned to.

\page

| Arcanist Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2nd             | Feather Fall (Air), <br> Grease (Earth), <br> Burning Hands (Fire),  <br>  Create or Destroy Water (Water) |
| 3rd             | Gust of Wind (Air),  <br> Maximillian's Earthen Grasp, <br> Scorching Ray (Fire),  <br> Rime's Binding Ice (Water)   |
| 5th             | Fly (Air),  <br> Erupting Earth (Earth),  <br> Fireball (Fire),  <br> Tidal Wave (Water)   |
| 7th             | Storm Sphere (Air),  <br> Stoneshape (Earth),  <br> Wall of Fire (Fire),  <br> Control Water (Water)  |
| 9th             | Control Winds (Air),  <br> Transmute Stone (Earth),  <br>  Flame Strike (Fire),  <br> Cone of Cold (Water)   |


### Chaotic Protection
Beginning at 6th level, you are more resilient against the
elements you attune to. While attuned to an element, you
have resistance to the associated damage type.

### Elemental Intensity
Beginning at 10th level, you draw upon the elemental planes
to intensity your magic. When you cast a spell that deals the
damage type associated with your currently attuned element,
you may reroll a number of the damage dice up to your
intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the
new rolls.

### Energetic Form
At 14th level, your attuned element bestows magical changes
to your form. You gain the following change to your
movement according to the following chart:

| Element | Movement |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| Air             | You gain a flying speed equal to your current speed that you can use for up to 10 minutes (recharges on short/long rest) |
| Earth             | You gain a burrow speed equal to half your current speed   |
| Fire             | Your base speed increases by 10ft   |
| Water            | You gain a swim speed equal to your current speed and can breathe underwater  |

In addition, once per long rest, as a bonus action, you can
gain the benefits of one of the following investiture spells for
10 minutes depending on which element you are currently
attuned to: Investiture of Wind (Air), Stone (Earth), Flame
(Fire), or Ice (Water).

<div style="margin-top:40px"></div>

### Elemental Apotheosis
At 18th level, you no longer need to choose which element
you are attuned to. You are considered to be attuned to air,
earth, fire, and water all at once, and gain the benefits
associated with each element from the "elementalist spells",
"chaotic protection", "elemental intensity", and "energetic
form" features.

When you use the "energetic form" feature to gain the
benefits of an investiture spell, you choose which spell to
benefit from.

## Occultist
Whenever one delves too deep into a study of magic, they
inevitably begin to hear a tantalizing promise of greater
knowledge and power from some otherworldly being. Those
arcanists that embrace this call and promise their loyalty or
services to those beings are known as occultists.

Occultists learn to summon the servants and creatures of
dangerous planes and bend them to their will. But an
occultist must remain wary, lest they find that their will is no
longer truly their own.

### Occultist Spells
| Arcanist Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2nd             | Dissonant Whispers, Unseen Servant   |
| 3rd             | Borrowed Knowledge, Crown of Madness   |
| 5th             | Spirit Shroud, Summon Lesser Demons   |
| 7th             | Banishment, Summon Greater Demon   |
| 9th             | Contact Other Plane, Planar Binding   |


### Dark Magic
Beginning at 2nd level, your magic is bolstered by the
knowledge of ancient beings you study. When your
spellcasting feature lets you learn an arcanist spell, you can
choose the new spell from the warlock spell list or the
arcanist spell list. These are arcanist spells for you.

In addition, you gain the Eldritch Ray feature from the Warlock class and at levels 5, 11, and 17 you gain the benefits of Extra Blast. You also learn to speak your choice of either Abyssal or Infernal

### Lesser Invocation
At 6th level, you gain your first gift of power from a dark
otherwordly being. From the list of eldritch invocations in the
warlock class, choose one invocation that you meet the
prerequisites for. You gain the benefits of the chosen
invocation.

For this and the "greater invocation" features, when an
invocation references your charisma, you may use your
intelligence instead. Similarly, arcanist spell slots can be used
in place of spell points for spells granted by invocations.

\page

### Fiendish Servant
Beginning at 10th level, you learn to summon a powerful
servant of the being you covenanted with. You learn the
summon fiend spell, which counts as an arcanist spell for you
and does not require material components to cast.

Once per long rest, you can cast this spell at without
expending a spell slot. The spell's level equals the level of the
highest spell slot(s) you have at your current level (e.g. 5th
level at arcanist level 10 or 9th level at arcanist level 17).

If cast at 5th level (as Summon Fiend is a 6th level spell), treat as if casting at 6th level, but the creature has 15 less hitpoints than indicated in its stat block, as well as a further -1 to AC (so its AC is 16) and a -2 to hit.

### Greater Invocation
At 14th level, you are bestowed with even greater power as
your connection to your dark patron grows. Choose two
additional invocations that you meet the prerequisites for
from the list of warlock eldritch invocations. You gain the
benefits of the chosen invocations.

### Hellish Master
Beginning at 18th level, you are an unwavering conduit of the
will of your patron, allowing you to directly control the
actions of fiends you summon. You gain the following
benefits:
- Creatures you summon with the summon lesser demons
and summon greater demon spells are always loyal to you
and hostile only to creatures you choose.
- You can direct the actions of creatures you summon
telepathically, requiring no action on your part.
- When you cast the summon lesser demons spell,
you choose the result of the d6 roll as well as
what specific type of demons you summon.
- When you cast the summon lesser demons,
summon greater demon, or summon fiend
spells, they are treated as if you cast them
at one level higher.


## Spell Specialist
Some arcanists believe that deep, tightly-focused
specialization is the optimal approach to magic. To do so,
these casters heavily emphasize a relatively small number of
spells and develop an unrivaled mastery over them.
Known as spell specialists, these arcanists often seek to
become an unparalleled virtuoso of their chosen spells,
learning to use them better than any other caster can.

### Specialty Spells
At 2nd level when you select this branch of study, choose one
of the arcanist spells you know of 1st level. That spell
becomes one of your "specialty spells". You gain various
options to strengthen that spell as you level up.

At 6th level, you choose a second arcanist spell up to 3rd
level to become a specialty spell.

At 10th level, you choose a third arcanist spell up to 5th
level to become a specialty spell.

Note that you cannot choose any of the spells you create
with the "spell writer" feature to be your specialty spells.
However, your specialty spells can still be a component of
spells you write.

### Improved Spells
At 2nd level, you learn to empower your specialty spell with
an enhanced property. Choose one of the following options
for your specialized spell:
- **Expansive**: You may increase the area affected by your
specialized spell by doubling its dimensions. For example,
circular radii are doubled, cones have double their normal
length, lines become twice as wide and long, etc. The spell
must already have an area to select this option.
- **Reaching**: The range of your specialized spell is doubled.
If the spell originally had a range of touch, its range
becomes 15 feet. The spell must not have a range of self to
select this option.
- **Enduring**: The duration of your specialized spell doubles.
The spell must have a duration other than instantaneous
to select this option.
- **Subtle**: You ignore any verbal or somatic components for
the specialized spell.
- **Careful**: You may choose number of creatures up to your
intelligence modifier in the area of your specialized spell.
Those creatures automatically succeed on any saving
throws to resist the effects of the spell.
- **Versatile**: When you cast your specialized spell, you may
choose to change its damage type to a type that appears in
another one of your spells/cantrips.

When you gain a new specialized spell at 6th and 10th levels,
choose one of the options to affect the new spell. The option
you select can be the same as or different than the one
selected for your first specialized spell.


### Versatile Expert
Beginning at 6th level, you become more versatile at twisting
your specialty spells in new ways. Once per short rest, when
you cast one of your specialty spells, you may choose one of
the other options from the "improved spells" feature to
augment your spell.

This choice temporarily replaces the original option you
selected for that spell for the current cast only. This cannot be
done at the same time as the "tweak spell" feature.

\page
<div class = "descriptive">
	<h5>Improved/Expert Spells and Blending</h5>
	
Whenever you cast your specialized spell, including when it is
cast as part of a blended spell, you may choose to apply
selected options from the "improved spells" and "expert
spells" features to the spell.
	
Similarly, if your specialized spell is part of a new spell you
create with the "spell writer" feature, your specialty spell
retains any options you have selected from these features
</div>

### Expert Spells
At 10th level, your specialty spells become even more
powerful. Choose one of the following options for each of
your specialized spells:
- **Potent**: Creatures make saving throws with disadvantage
to resist the effects of your specialized spell.
- **Accurate**: You have advantage on attack rolls to hit with
your specialized spell.
- **Deadly**: When you roll damage or healing for your
specialized spell, you may reroll any number of the dice
once, but you must use the new rolls.
- **Sweeping**: You may target one additional creature with
your specialized spell. The spell must target creatures and
must not create multiple projectiles (e.g. magic missile) to
select this option.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;If your spell would have targeted only one creature
without this option, you must complete a short rest before
you may use this option again for that spell.

- **Prolific**: Your specialized spell creates a number of
additional projectiles equal to one half of the original
amount of projectiles (rounded down). The spell must
create multiple projectiles (e.g. magic missile or scorching
ray) to select this option.
- **Swift**: You may cast your specialized spell as a bonus
action a number of times equal to your intelligence
modifier between long rests. The spell must have a
casting time of one action to select this option.

### Specialty Blend
Beginning at 14th level, it is almost effortless to blend your
specialty spells. When you use the spell blending feature and
both of the component spells are your specialty spells, the
required spell slot for your blended spell is one level lower
than normal.

### Mastered Spell
At 18th level, you become the unmatched master of your
favorite spell. Choose one of your specialty spells. You may
select an additional option from the "improved spell" and
"expert spell" features to apply to that spell.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

## Twilight Sage
Many mages throughout history have studied how magic
interacts with the soul and death. Twilight sages know that
magic permeates the essence of life itself, and they study how
that magic persists following the death or "the twilight of life".
If life and soul can be controlled and understood, the
underlying twilight magic can be harnessed.

### Twilight Sage Spells

| Arcanist Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2nd             | False Life, Hex   |
| 3rd             | Gentle Repose, Wither and Bloom   |
| 5th             | Revivify, Vampiric Touch   |
| 7th             | Blight, Death Ward   |
| 9th             | Enervation, Raise Dead   |

### Twilight Magic
Beginning at level 2, your soul itself becomes partially infused
with the weave of magic, empowering it when you cast spells.
Whenever you cast a spell, you gain temporary hit points
equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

If you gain temporary hit points from a spell you cast, they
are added to those you gain from this feature and treated as
one pool of temporary hit points.

### Soul Speaker
At 6th level, you learn to reach into the residual soul essence
of recently deceased creatures to read their memories. Once
per long rest, you may cast the spell speak with dead on the
corpse of a creature that has died within 10 days, without
expending a spell slot.

The spell acts differently when cast this way. Instead of
allowing the corpse to speak, you hear the answers to your
questions in your mind as you probe the lingering soul
memories. The memories you find are generally brief and
cryptic, but are also always true.

### Siphon Death
Beginning at 10th level, you can absorb the magical
energies a creature releases on death to restore your
own spellcasting power. When a medium or larger
creature dies within 60 feet, you can use your reaction
to recover spell slots with a combined level equal to or
less than half your arcanist level (rounded down). Each
spell slot recovered this way must be 5th-level or less.
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until
you complete a short or long rest.

### Persistent Soul
Beginning at 14th level, the twilight magic flowing through
your soul makes you unnaturally hard to kill and improves
your ability to reunite souls and bodies. This grants you the
following benefits:
\page
- Whenever you make a death saving throw, you do so with
advantage.
- The duration a creature can be dead and still be affected
by spells like revivify or raise dead is doubled if you are
casting the spell.
- You can be dead for up to ten times as long as normal and
still be affected by spells like revivify or raise dead.

### Spirit and Body
Beginning at 18th level, you have mastered control over your
own spirit and soul, granting you the following benefits.

#### Project Spirit
Once per long rest, as a bonus action, you can separate your
spirit from your body and become incorporeal for up to one
minute, while temporarily transferring your corporeal body to
a pocket of the ethereal plane. While in this form, you can
pass through solid objects and have immunity to nonmagical
bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. In addition,
while in your incorporeal form, when you hit a creature with
a spell or a creature fails a saving throw to resist one of your
spells, that creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage.

You can return to your physical form early as a bonus
action. When your incorporeal form ends, you resummon
your body to your current space and your spirit and body are
rejoined.

If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature
when your spirit form ends, you are immediately shunted to
the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take
force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are
moved.
#### Inhabit Corpse
If you die, you may have your spirit attempt to inhabit the
corpse of a small or medium humanoid creature within 60
feet. The body must be sufficiently intact to sustain life. If you
do so, you gain three levels of exhaustion. In addition, you
have 0 current hit points and must make death saving throws
to stabilize as normal.

If you stabilize, you successfully inhabit the new body. Your
strength, dexterity, and constitution scores become equal to
those the creature had in life (maximum of 20); these
changes can affect your AC, hit points, etc. Your other
statistics remain the same.

If you fail to stabilize, you die again and can only be
restored to life by means of a true resurrection or wish spell.

# Bloodrager
A
powerful goliath wielding a man-sized axe leads
his charging warband against their invaders. As
the parties are about to clash, the goliath
unleashes an ear-shattering shout as his arms
and weapon erupt into bright flame. Despite the
heat, the warrior is uninjured as he directs the
flame into an whirlwind of embers
encompassing his foes.

A dwarvish gladiator finds himself facing an impossible
monstrosity in the arena he has come to know so well. The
beast charges and leaps towards their prey, but as it closes in,
a bright array of cobalt scales appears on the exposed skin of
the fighter and two great wings erupt from their back. With a
roar, the dwarf takes to the sky, and the beast crashes to the
ground finding no target.

A firbolg wanders her forest home, seeking the aberrations
that have been defiling it. Finding their corrosive forms
destroying a holy grove, the wanderer focuses the power of
nature in her blood. Great tendrils of woody growth extend
from her restraining the horrid creatures as she dashes
forward swinging her quarterstaff with abandon.

Some heroes learn magic through intense study, some are
loaned the power by diety or nature, but a rare few gain their
power through their ancestral blood. Bloodragers are
warriors who tap into the energies contained within their
arcane blood to enter a rage-like state where the full potential
of their inherited power is unleashed into their attacks and
spells.

### Ancestral Power
While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep
reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power
that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers’ veins surge
with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for
spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which
their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of
their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power.

Through their inherited power, bloodragers can cast
some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager’s magic
is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their
physical prowess.

### Arcane Blood
Like barbarians, bloodragers use their physical might and
inherent power to charge into danger to keep their people
and their allies safe. A bloodrager may leave their home for
a number of reasons, and, due to their abilities, they will
find themselves naturally suited to a life of adventure.
From their barbaric roots, bloodragers are accustomed
to a life of constant challenge and peril, and are often
loathe to settle down and let their inner power lie
dormant.

In an adventuring party, bloodragers take the
frontline, using their mighty attacks and savage
magic to overwhelm foes and draw attention
away from their allies. The presence of a
bloodrager is hard to ignore, especially when
their arcane power is unleashed in a bloodrage.

### Creating a Bloodrager
The most important question to consider when creating your
bloodrager is the origin of your power. When you make your
character, you choose the nature of your bloodrager's arcane
blood, such as a draconic ancestry or raw elemental power.
However, you also choose the details of your power's origin.
For instance, is it a blessing, passed down to you from distant
ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed
with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?

Consider what drove you to leave your old life behind in
favor of adventure. Were you cast out due to fear of your
power? Or perhaps as a rite of passage to become a true
warrior? Do you feel a longing for your old life and a deep
connection to your people? Or are you running from your past
and plan on cutting all ties?

Consider as well your motivations for adventure. Are you
seeking the origin of your power in order to reconnect with
your ancestry? Or do you intend to end the blood curse that
has plagued your family for generations? Are you simply
accustomed to the life of a wanderer? Or would you like to
settle but find it difficult to be trusted in civilized society?

#### Quick Build
You can make a bloodrager quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability
score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the
outlander background.

#### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**: To qualify for multiclassing
with the Bloodrager class, you must meet these
prerequisites: 13 Strength and 13 Charisma.
<br>
**Proficiencies**: When you multiclass into the Bloodrager
class, you gain the following proficiencies: Simple weapons,
martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, shields.
<br>
**Spell Slots**: You add half your Bloodrager levels (rounded down)
to determine multiclass spell slots.

- **Rugged Arcane Explorer’s Set** (Cost 135 gold): Greatsword, 4 javelins, hide, climbing gear, explorer’s pack, Arcane Focus
- **Magical Tracker’s Set** (Cost 141 gold): Greataxe, shortbow and 20 arrows, chain shirt, explorer’s pack, Component Pouch

### Bloodline
At 1st level, you choose a bloodline that has bestowed your
arcane power. The bloodline you choose grants you features
at levels 1, 6, 10, 14, and 18.

The Draconic, Elemental, Fey, Abyssal, Celestial, Undead,
and Arcane bloodlines are shown below.

### Bloodrage
Starting at 1st level, you fight
with the primal energy of your
bloodline. On your turn, you can
enter a bloodrage as a bonus
action.

While bloodraging, you gain the
following benefits if you aren’t
wearing heavy armor:
- You have advantage on Strength
checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee
weapon attack using Strength,
or cast a bloodrager spell that
deals damage, you gain a bonus
to the damage roll equal to your
bloodrage die. This die
increases as you gain levels as a
bloodrager, as shown in the
Bloodrage Die column of the
Bloodrager table.
- You have resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.

Your bloodrage lasts for 1 minute. It
ends early if you are knocked unconscious
or if your turn ends and you have not
attacked a hostile creature, cast a spell, or
taken damage since your last turn. You
can also end your bloodrage on your turn
as a bonus action.

Once you have bloodraged the number
of times shown for your bloodrager level
in the Bloodrages column of the
Bloodrager table, you must finish a long rest
before you can bloodrage again.

While bloodraging, you are not able to cast or
concentrate on spells except for bloodrager spells.

### Spellcasting
You have learned to draw on the arcane power of your blood through life-and-death struggle.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Bloodrager spell list. You learn additional Bloodrager cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as seen in the Cantrips Known column of the Bloodrager table.

#### Casting Spells
The Blodrager table shows how many spell slots of each level you have to cast your spells. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all spent spell slots upon finishing a long rest. 

You know a number of Bloodrager spells shown in the Bloodrager table under 'spells known'. Each time you gain a Bloodrager Level,
you may learn one bloodrager spell and replace one of the
bloodrager spells you know with another spell of your choice
from the bloodrager spell list. Each of these spells must be of
a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the
Bloodrager table.

#### Spellcasting ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your
bloodrager spells. You use your Charisma
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a bloodrager spell
you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.
<div style="text-align:center;">
**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
<br>
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for
your bloodrager spells.

### Combat Maneuvers
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Cutting Omen, Adamant Mountain, Tempered Iron, Tooth and Claw You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You use your maneuvers by spending exertion points, but you do not gain an exertion pool. Instead, at the start of each of your turns you can expend spell slots of 1st-level or higher to gain exertion points that go into a temporary exertion pool which lasts until you start your next long rest . You gain 2 exertion points for a 1st-level spell slot, and 2 more for each spell slot level above 1st. Only spell slots gained from the Bloodrager class can be expended in this way.

\page

The Maneuvers Known column of the Bloodrager table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.


### Savage Magic
At 2nd level, you can empower your spells with the raw
energy of your bloodline at the cost of your own health. When
you cast a bloodrager spell, you may choose to cast savagely.
Doing so gives you an expertise die on the spell attack roll if one is
required and gives enemies disadvantage on the first save
they make to resist the spell. However, you additionally take
damage equal to three times the level of the spell cast.

### Blood Sanctuary
At 3rd level, the arcane power in your veins protects you from
harmful magic. While bloodraging, you have an expertise die on
saving throws against magical spells and effects.

### Intimidating Power
At 3rd level, your natural power strikes fear into your
enemies. You have advantage on intimidation checks towards
creatures who have witnessed your bloodrage within the last
hour.

### Warrior Born
Also at 3rd level, the ways of combat that have come naturally to you bring new and unexpected lessons. Choose one of the following:
#### Agitate
Many battles have taught you how to spot aggressive body language like a pursed eyebrow, tensed temple, or protruding vein, and you’ve mastered using these cues to unsettle others outside of combat. Make an Intimidation check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see and hear within 20 feet. On a success, you subtly press the creature to act out. What exactly the creature does—back away quickly, blurt out something compromising, draw a weapon, look towards a concealed or disguised companion, protectively touch something it is carrying—is at the Narrator’s discretion.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest .
#### Fearsome Reputation
Word spreads of your prodigious strength or how terrifying you can be in battle. Whenever you are in a settlement, at least one commoner approaches you with a modest gift or bribe and beseeches you to help settle a feud, move a large obstacle, or otherwise make use of your impressive might. In addition to their offering, they are eager to tell you about their home and neighbors.

#### Imposing Prowess
When an ally you can see and hear makes a Deception or Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to support them with an intimidating display of strength or unsettling glower. Your ally rerolls the check, gaining an expertise die on the roll.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest .

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20
using this feature.

You can forgo taking this
feature to take a feat of your choice instead.
### Developed Innovations
Whether in the ruins of an ancient civilization, the barren terrain of the hinterlands, or the back alleys of a prosperous city, bloodragers are adept at surviving and interacting with their environments. 

At 1st level you gain a developed talent of your choice. Your developed talents are detailed at the end of the class description. The Talents Known column of the Bloodrager table shows when you learn more developed talents.


### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the attack action on your turn.

### Martial Presence
At 6th level your methodology to battle seeps further into the way you interact with others—and how they interact with you. Choose one of the following:

#### Forceful
People respond favorably to your vigor. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Persuasion checks.

In addition, in every settlement you visit you inspire a number of followers equal to your proficiency bonus. Your followers perform minor tasks to help you while you are there, feed you and your allies, carry your belongings to nearby destinations, share their mount animals, reveal some of their secrets to try and gain your favor, and ask you for help before turning to the authorities with a problem

\page

#### Mighty
You turn your toughness into a tool when imposing upon others. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Intimidation checks. 

In addition, when you enter a tavern or other social gathering, you can make a DC 15 Intimidation check while loudly declaring that you are looking for something or someone. On a success, most of the people there look at and otherwise point out whoever they believe is the person you are looking for or the person most likely to know about what you are seeking.
#### Scary
It’s commonly thought that it’s best not to ask you for too much clarification or detail. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Deception checks.

In addition, when you fail a Deception check against a creature, it makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Deception score. On a failure, it thinks twice about your dishonesty and your Deception check becomes a success.
### Fierce Caster
At 7th level, your spells and weapon attacks become
inseparable parts of your fierce offense. When you use your
action to cast a bloodrager spell, you may make a single
melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Battle Moxie
At 9th level, your experiences in combat teach you more about how to live in the world. Choose one of the following.

#### Provoking Attitude
You know how to piss people off. You can expend one use of Bloodrage and choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear or see you. The creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your Spellcasting DC. On a failure, it makes or accepts a challenge. The nature of this challenge is at the Narrator’s discretion but is usually a duel or opposed check: archery with Dexterity, arm-wrestling with Strength, competing with a gaming set, distance running with Constitution, wrestling with Athletics, and so on. 

#### Roaring Pause
When initiative is rolled you can expend one use of Bloodrage to make an Intimidation check (DC 8 + number of creatures that rolled initiative) to briefly unveil the boundless fury within in a furious roar. On a success each creature stops what it is doing and can only make statements and a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check on its turn. On a success by 5 or more initiative is rerolled, and you choose a number of creatures equal to your Constitution modifier to gain advantage on their initiative roll.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

#### Takes One to Know One
You know another warrior when you see one. When you see a creature, you know if it is proficient with more than simple weapons or has access to combat maneuvers

### Sorcerous Rage
At 11th level, your bloodrages are joined by a surge of magic.
When you use your bonus action to bloodrage, you may
additionally cast a spell that targets only yourself as part of
that same bonus action by expending a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher.

If the spell has a duration of one minute or longer, it
instead lasts until your bloodrage ends. Additionally, the spell
must normally have a casting time of one action or bonus
action.

### Latent Power
By 13th level, your sorcerous lineage starts to manifest as something people can subconsciously sense, even if they know nothing beyond the mundane, and it affects how they see you. Choose one of the following.

#### All Eyes
You gain an expertise die on Performance and Persuasion checks. In addition, you can use your magic to make your presence known. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to put out a subtle pulse that causes all creatures within 60 feet to take notice of you, allowing you to speak and be heard even in the midst of chaos. During combat, this notice lasts only a split second—not long enough to distract, but allowing you to make a Charisma check as part of the bonus action used to activate this feature.

#### Daunting Energy
You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. If you fail an ability check or saving throw against a creature trying to intimidate you, or against an effect that would cause you to become frightened , you can spend 1 sorcery point to immediately reroll the check or save.

#### Unsuspecting
You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you fail on a Deception check against a humanoid, you can use a combination of fast-talk and your magic to make them forget your misstep, spending 1 sorcery point to reroll the check. On a success, their memory skips a beat and fills in the gap with your new story. On a failure, not only do they not believe you, but anyone who can cast spells and observed the exchange (including your target, if applicable) knows that arcane subterfuge was attempted.

### Unyielding Blood
At 15th level, your bond with the mystic power in your blood
becomes unshakeable. Once per long rest, when you fail a
constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a
bloodrager spell, you may choose to succeed instead.

### Eldritch Rage
At level 20, your raw arcane power is unleashed whenever
you bloodrage. When you use the sorcerous rage feature
upon entering a bloodrage, you may cast up to two spells that
target only yourself, instead of just one.

Each spell requires expending a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher, and follows the same requirements and
durations outlined in the sorcerous rage feature.

### Developed Innovations
#### Agile Sprinter
You are adept at traversing obstacles while running, able to efficiently and rapidly climb and leap between trees, vines, rooftops, and ropes. You gain an expertise die on Athletics and Acrobatics checks made to climb, run, and swing.

#### Lead the Pack
&nbsp;*Prerequisite: 5th level*
<br>
Your unfaltering actions inspire your teammates to greater efforts. You gain an expertise die on Athletics or Acrobatics checks made to climb, jump, run, and swim. When your party makes a group Athletics or Acrobatics check, you may apply the results of your roll to yourself and one ally. You can choose which ally to apply your result to after everyone has rolled, but must do so before the Narrator says whether you succeed or fail.

#### Lingering Touch
When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair, bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. If you are carrying the shed piece and attuned to it when you see the creature from which it originated, you immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at which point the attunement ends. At the Narrator’s discretion, you may learn additional cryptic information from being attuned to such things.

#### Mage Hunter
When tracking a creature that can cast at least 1 spell, you can attempt to do so by focusing on the mystic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use your Charisma for any ability checks made to track it.

#### Magnetic Step
You can move along vertical surfaces at half your Speed without needing to make an ability check. If you end your turn on such a surface, you immediately fall unless you have some other way to support yourself.

#### Mark of the Wilderness
You have traveled far and seen much, and those around you can tell. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Strength when rolling an Intimidation or Persuasion check.

#### Natural Tracker
After making a connection with another creature, however tenuous, you make a connection that gives you an edge when pursuing it. After you spend at least 1 minute observing a creature, you gain an expertise die on checks made to track that specific creature.

#### Path of Blustery Autumns
Instead of fighting the sharp winds you have learned from them. You gain a +10 foot increase to your speed when calculating your Travel Pace. Additionally, you can choose to ignore difficult terrain outside of combat.

#### Path of Drowning Springs
&nbsp;*Prerequisite: 5th level*
<br>
The rains have taught you the ways of the overflowing rivers. You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed and can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + twice your Constitution modifier.

In addition, while swimming you can use a bonus action and spend one use of Rage to move your swim speed in a straight line.
#### Path of Lean Winters
The lessons of the snows have put you beyond mere cold and hunger. You gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of cold weather as though you were wearing cold weather gear, but without the disadvantages in hot weather. Additionally, you can go without Supply for a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before suffering a level of fatigue . 

#### Path of Scorching Summers
By emulating the beasts of the desert you are above the concerns of heat and thirst. You gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of hot weather as though you were wearing hot weather gear, but without the disadvantages in cold weather. You also gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of thirst. 

#### Retrace
By spending 1 minute in meditation, you can reflect on the magical aura you leave behind as you travel. After doing so, you can perfectly retrace the steps you’ve taken in the past 4 hours.

\page

#### Strange Traces
While traveling, you can spend 1 exertion to obscure your trail. For the next hour, any tracks your group leaves become random, zigzagging, and incomprehensible. Creatures have disadvantage on Survival checks to track you and become lost on a failed check.

#### Ominous Insight
When you know, you know, you know? When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can attempt to draw on your magics to find an answer and reroll the check. On a failure, your attempt clouds your mind and you have disadvantage on Intelligence checks until you finish a short rest . While suffering this disadvantage, you can’t use Ominous Insight again.


#### Wode Sense
While traveling, any time you enter an illusory terrain or magic is used to cause you to become lost, you always notice within 1 minute of being affected.

## Bloodrager Bloodlines
Bloodrager powers come from a variety of different sources,
called "bloodlines". These different bloodlines describe the
origin of your magical ability and provide various capabilities
bestowed by your arcane blood.

{{classTable,decoration,frame
##### Bloodrager Bloodlines
| Bloodline 					  | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------:|
| Abyssal     | Demonic abilities|
| Arcane  | Arcane speciality |
| Celestial    | Angelic abilities|
| Draconic    | Draconic abilities|
| Elemental      | Elemental Abilities|
| Fey     | Primal and Trickery-based Abilities|
| Undead         | Necrotic abilities|
}}

## Abyssal Bloodline
The dark powers of the abyss permeate your being due to the
demonic blood flowing through your veins. Due to a bloodline
curse or fiendish ancestor, abyssal bloodragers can transform
into a dark form that becomes increasingly demonic as their
power grows.

### Chaotic Blood
At 1st level, your blood imbues you with dark powers from the
abyss. Choose fire, cold, or lightning. The chosen damage
type becomes your demonic element. When you deal extra
damage with your bloodrage die, you may choose to change
its damage type to your demonic element.

### Horrific Claws
At 1st level, when you bloodrage, you may choose to
transform your arms and hands into a set of inhuman claws
as part of that same bonus action. These claws are treated as
melee weapons using strength and deal 1d8 + your Strength
modifier slashing damage.

When you take the attack action on your turn and only
attack with your claws, you may use your bonus action to
make one additional claw attack, adding your strength
modifier to the damage as normal.

### Abyssal Resistance
At 6th level, your demonic blood offers enhanced durability
to your mortal frame. You gain resistance
to poison and to your
demonic element.

### Demonic Aura
At 10th level, you carry an unnerving presence about you,
subtly breaking the will of your foes. Hostile creatures within
10 ft. of you suffer a penalty to saving throws equal to your
charisma modifier.

### Fiend Wings 
At 14th level, when you begin a bloodrage, you may choose to
sprout a pair of demon wings from your back, gaining a flying
speed equal to your current speed plus 10 ft. They last for
one minute, until you become unconscious, or until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

### Abyssal Form
At 18th level, you take on the true, horrible form inherited
from your demonic ancestry. Once per long rest, when you
begin a bloodrage, you may choose to take on your demon
form. You remain in this form until you become unconscious
or your bloodrage ends.

In your demon form, your size becomes large, your
creature type is fiend, and you are immune to your demonic
element. Additionally, the damage of your claw attacks
increases to 1d12 + your strength modifier.

In this form, your demonic aura extends to 30ft. When a
creature begins its turn within your demonic aura, they must
make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or
become frightened and take damage equal to 1d12 + your
charisma modifier of your demonic element. They can repeat
the saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns. On a
success, they are immune to being
frightened by your aura
for 24 hours.

## Arcane Bloodline
Unlike other bloodragers, your bloodline is not derived from a
particular type of creature or being; instead, your blood is
inherently coupled with the weave of magic permeating all
existence. This gives you increased command over magic,
including both your own spells and those cast around you.

### Forceful Power
At 1st level, your melee strikes are infused with raw magical
power. When you deal extra damage with your bloodrage die,
you may choose to change its damage type to force.

### Arcane Sanctuary
At 1st level, your blood connection to the weave allows you to
protect yourself from harmful magic. Once per short rest,
when you fail a saving throw against a magical spell or effect
you may choose to succeed instead.

### Spell Flexibility
At 6th level, the essence of magic permeating your being
gives you more flexibility over your casting. You can learn one
spell from any class list. Spells gained from this feature count
as bloodrager spells for you and must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. You learn one
more such spell at levels
10 and 14.

\page

### Unchained Power
At 10th level, your blood commands the weave, imbuing your
spells with heightened power. While bloodraging, when you
expend a spell slot to cast a spell, you may choose to cast the
chosen spell at one level higher than the spell slot used.

The spell slot used must still be equal to or greater than
the base level of the spell. For example, you cannot cast Hold
Monster with a 4th level spell slot using this feature.

### Arcane Travel
At 14th level, your physical form becomes more closely tied to
magical energy. As a bonus action, you may expend any level
spell slot to cast misty step.

In addition, when you use a bonus action to begin a
bloodrage you may choose to teleport up to 30 ft. as part of
that same bonus action, without expending a spell slot.

### Caster Bane
At 18th level, your bloodrages can disrupt the weave of magic
around you. Once per long rest, when you bloodrage you may
choose to create a 10 ft. radius antimagic field centered on
yourself. This field lasts until your bloodrage ends and
requires your concentration to maintain.

This field has the same properties as a field created with
the spell Antimagic Field. The one exception is that your own
bloodrager spells still function as normal
within the field.

## Celestial Bloodline
You have a divine ancestry, blessed by the gods, granting you
the ability to cull evil wherever it is found. At the height of
their power, celestial bloodragers gain angelic abilities to
protect themselves and their allies from dark forces.

### Sanguine Radiance
At 1st level, the divine nature of your blood imbues you with
brilliant energy. When you deal extra damage with your
bloodrage die, you may choose to change its damage type to
radiant.

### Holy Resilience
At 1st level, inherent holy energy protects you from harm.
When you begin a bloodrage, you gain temporary hit points
equal to your bloodrager level plus your charisma modifier.

### Guide from Evil
At 6th level, your holy blood holds a natural inclination
towards good and disdain for evil. You may cast the spell
Detect Evil and Good a number of times per long rest equal
to your charisma modifier (minimum of 1). In addition, you
gain resistance to radiant damage.

### Sacred Aura
At 10th level, your divine heritage grants you
immense protection against creatures of unholy
origin. Whenever you are bloodraging, you are under
the effect of the spell Protection from Evil and Good.

### Angelic Wings
At 14th level, when you begin a bloodrage, you may choose to
sprout a pair of angelic wings from your back, gaining a flying
speed equal to your current speed plus 10 ft. They last for
one minute, until you become unconscious, or until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

### Divine Being
At 18th level, your divine heritage allows you to temporarily
take on an angelic form. Once per long rest, when you begin a
bloodrage, you may choose to take on your angelic form. You
remain in this form until you become unconscious or your
bloodrage ends.

In your angelic form, your creature type is celestial, you are
immune to radiant and resistant to necrotic damage, and
your attacks and damaging spells deal an additional 2d8
radiant damage.

In addition, while in your angelic form you are always
under the effect of the spell Detect Evil and Good, and all
allies within 30 ft. are under the effect of Protection from Evil
and Good.

## Draconic Bloodline
Draconic blood flows through your veins, whether caused by
a draconic ancestor or a dragon's blessing. Draconic
bloodragers can harness their magestic power to fuel their
magic and strike with fury as a dragon would.

### Dragon Ancestor
At 1st level, you choose the color of dragon that bestowed
magic on your bloodline. You gain a draconic element that is
the damage type corresponding to your color choice on the
following chart.

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| Black                 | Acid     |
| Blue               | Lightning     |
| Brass               | Fire     |
| Bronze             | Lightning     |
| Copper             | Acid     |
| Gold            | Fire     |
| Green             | Acid     |
| Red            | Fire     |
| Silver             | Cold     |
| White            | Cold     |

\page

When you deal extra damage with your bloodrage die, you
may choose to change its damage to your
draconic element.
### Draconic Resistance
At 1st level, your draconic bloodline grants you increased
resilience. You have a sheen of dragon scales covering
portions of your body that grant you a +1 bonus to AC. This
bonus increases to +2 at bloodrager level 14.

### Elemental Purity
At 6th level, you have a deepened bond with your draconic
element. You gain resistance to that damage type. In addition,
when you deal damage that is your draconic element, you
may choose to treat a creature's immunity to that damage
type as resistance instead.

### Breath Weapon
At 10th level, you learn to breathe the elements like a dragon.
Once during each bloodrage, you may replace one of your
attacks with a breath weapon attack.

When you do so, you breathe a 20 ft. cone of your draconic
element. All creatures in the area of your breath weapon
must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save
DC. A creature takes 8d6 damage on a failed save, and half as
much on a success.
### Dragon Wings
At 14th level, when you begin a bloodrage, you may choose to
sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying
speed equal to your current speed plus 10 ft. They last for
one minute, until you become unconscious, or until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

### Dragon's Mastery
At 18th level, you can bring the full might of a dragon to bear
against your enemies. Once per long rest, when you begin a
bloodrage, you may choose to take the form of a dragon of
your draconic color. You remain in this form until you become
unconscious or your bloodrage ends.

In your dragon form, your creature type is dragon, your
size becomes large, you become immune to your draconic
element, your draconic resistance AC bonus
increases to +3, and you gain the benefits of
your dragon wings until you leave the form.

In addition, you gain two claw
attacks and one bite attack, which
count as melee weapon attacks
using strength that you are
proficient in. You may perform
all three as your attack action
on your turn. Your claw attacks
deal slashing damage equal 1d8 + your Strength modifier and
your bite attack deals piercing
damage equal to 1d12 + your
Strength modifier.

## Elemental Bloodline
Your bloodline is intertwined with primordial elemental
forces. Elemental blodoragers can call upon the elemental
planes to empower their attacks, destroy their enemies, and
become one with elemental chaos.

| Elemental Plane | Damage Type |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| Air                 | Lightning     |
| Earth               | Acid     |
| Fire               | Fire     |
| Water             | Cold     |

When you deal extra damage with your bloodrage die, you
may choose to change its damage to your intrinsic element.

### Elemental Strikes
At 1st level, once per long rest when you bloodrage, you may
choose to empower your attacks with elemental energy.
When you do so, for the next minute, you may add extra
damage equal to your charisma modifier to melee attacks you
perform. The damage type is your intrinsic element. You may
perform this feature twice per long rest starting at bloodrager
level 14.
### Elemental Purity
At 6th level, you have a deepened bond with your intrinsic
element. You gain resistance to that damage type. In addition,
when you deal damage that is your intrinsic element, you may
choose to treat a creature's immunity to that damage type as
resistance instead.
### Powerful Surge
At 10th level, you can focus your rage into a torrent of
elemental energy. While bloodraging, you may replace one of
your attacks with a surge of elemental energy in a 10ft. radius
centered on yourself. All other creatures in the area must
make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.
Creatures take 12d6 damage of your intrinsic element on a
failure or half as much on a success.

Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again
until you have completed a long or short rest.
### Energetic Form
At 14th level, the elemental plane to which your blood is
bound bestows magical changes to your form. You gain the
following change to your movement according to the
following chart.

\page

| Elemental | Movement |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| Air                 | You gain a flying speed equal to your current speed for up to 10 minutes, usable once per short rest     |
| Earth               | You gain a burrow speed equal to half your current speed    |
| Fire               | Your base speed increases by 10ft     |
| Water             | You gain a swim speed equal to your current speed and can breathe underwater    |

### Primordial Body
At 18th level, you can become a manifestation of your chosen
element. Once per long rest, when you begin a bloodrage, you
may choose to take on the form of an elemental of your
chosen elemental plane. You remain in this form until you
become unconscious or your bloodrage ends.

In your elemental form, your size becomes large, your
creature type is elemental, you are immune to your intrinsic
element, and you can move through a space as narrow as 1
inch wide without squeezing. In addition, you gain an ability
corresponding to your chosen elemental plane according to
the following chart. Note that the whirlwind, slam, and whelm
abilities may apply your bloodrage die to one target when
used.

## Fey Bloodline
At some point, your bloodline merged with the essence of the
feywild, perhaps through a blessing or curse from a powerful
fey creature. Fey bloodragers can use feywild energies to
confuse and enchant those around them, and command
natural powers to do their bidding.

### Fey Bloodline Spell List
The Fey Bloodrager gains access to the following spells, and
may learn them after they have reached the appropriate
Bloodrager level. They are bloodrager spells for you.

| Bloodrager Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2nd               | charm person, disguise self     |
| 5th               | spike growth, suggestion    |
| 9th               | fear, plant growth     |
| 13th             	| charm monster, confusion    |
| 17th							| dominate person, tree stride |

### Sylvan Blood
At 1st level, when you deal extra damage with your bloodrage
die, you may choose to change its damage type to psychic.

### Fey Trickery
At 1st level, your attacks afflict your enemies both physically
and mentally. Once per round, when you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack, you may inflict the charmed or
frightened condition on that creature until the beginning of
your next turn.

After a creature has been affected by this feature, it is
immune to the ability for 24 hours.

### Land's Stride
At 6th level, you instinctively pass
through the harshest terrain without
issue. Moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra
movement. You can also pass through
nonmagical plants without being
slowed by them and without taking
damage from them if they have thorns,
spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on
saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede
movement, such those created by the
entangle spell.

### Raging Overgrowth
At 10th level, the forces of nature respond to the
power of your blood. Once per long rest, when
you begin a bloodrage, you may target a number of
creatures you can see equal to your charisma
modifier as part of that same bonus action.

Targeted creatures must succeed a strength saving throw
against your spell save DC, or become restrained in magical
roots and plants. Restrained creatures may use their action to
make a strength check against your spell save DC to escape.

This feature has no effect against creatures that are currently
flying or are otherwise at least 5 ft. away from the ground.

### One with Nature
At 14th level, your bloodline earns you the friendship of
plants and animals. Unless magically compelled, beast and
plant creatures will not attack you or target you with harmful
abilities or magical effects unless you first attack or
otherwise harm them.

Additionally, a number of times per long rest equal to your
charisma modifier, you may transport yourself between two
trees of the same type within 500 ft. as part of your
movement, as if using the tree stride spell.

### Sylvan Trance
At 18th level, you can summon the powers of the feywild into
your being, becoming at once beguiling and yet horrifying.
Once per long rest, when you begin a bloodrage, you may
choose to take on your fey form. You remain in this form until
you become unconscious or your bloodrage ends.

In your fey form, your creature type is fey, and you are
immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.

Additionally, when you use your fey trickery feature to
inflict the charmed or frightened condition, the targeted
creature is also entranced. An entranced creature may not
perform reactions. In addition, at the beginning of each of its
turns, an entranced creature must make a wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC.

\page

On a failure, the creature
does nothing and its turn ends. On a success, the creature is
no longer entranced.

Creatures that are immune to the
charmed condition are immune to being entranced.

## Undead Bloodline
The foul corruption of undeath is an innate part of you.
Somewhere in the past, the essence of death itself became
infused with your lineage bestowing frightening power when
your bloodrage.

### Touch of Death
At 1st level, negative energy directly harms your target's life
essence. When you deal extra damage with your bloodrage
die, you may choose to change its damage type to necrotic.

### Lifedrain
At 1st level, your attacks steal the life force of your enemies.
Once per round, when you deal damage with your bloodrage
die, you heal a number of hit points equal to the damage
dealt.

In addition, enemies damaged by your bloodrage die can
not regain hit points until the beginning
of your next turn.

### Undying Vitality
At 6th level, your life force is bolstered by unnatural vitality.
You have resistance to necrotic damage and your hit point
maximum can not be reduced.

### Omens of the Dead
At 10th level, you can unleash an aura of necrotic energy
causing hostile creatures to have disturbing visions. Once per
short rest, you can use your action to make all creatures of
your choice, within a 20ft. radius of yourself, make a wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, that creature has visions of their
own or a loved one's death causing them to be stunned until
the beginning of your next turn.

### Incorporeal Form
At 14th level, your connection to undeath allows you to
temporarily shed the shackles of your physical form. When
you use this feature, you and your held equipment become
incorporeal until the beginning of your next turn. During this
time, you can pass through solid objects as if they were
difficult terrain, and are resistant to all nonmagical damage.

You may use this feature number of times per long rest
equal to your charisma modifier.

If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or
creature when your incorporeal form ends, you
are immediately shunted to the nearest
unoccupied space that you can occupy and
take force damage equal to twice the number
of feet you are moved.

### Harbinger of Undeath 
At 18th level, you are as much alive as
you are undead allowing you to enter a
state of partial-life and infusing those
around you with the energy of undeath.

Once per long rest, when you begin a
bloodrage, you may choose to take on
your undead form. You remain in this
form until you become unconscious or
your bloodrage ends.

In your undead form, you are under the
effect of your incorporeal form feature,
you have immunity to nonmagical
bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing
damage, and you deal an extra 2d8
necrotic damage with every attack
and damaging spell.

In addition, while in your undead
form, allies within 30 ft. have
advantage on death saving throws, and
any small or medium creature (not
including undead or constructs) that
dies within 30 ft. of you becomes a
specter (your DM has the statistics)
that raises at the beginning of your
next turn, acts on your initiative,
and attacks the nearest hostile
creature.
	
Your raised specters
cease to exist when your
bloodrage ends.

# Blue Traveller
Standing outside the gaping maw of a cavern entrance you
hear a booming echo of an older man sound from within the
cave’s depths, “Hey! You! Yeah you sleeping worm! Wake up!
It’s time for dinner!”

The cave then shakes with a deafening roar while
emanating a soft orange glow from deep within. The sound
stops, and the light fades once more to darkness. Suddenly
you see emerge before you sprinting out of the cave’s
mouth, with blue cape still aflame and flapping in
the wind, is the man you had heard taunting mere
moments ago. He is a short human, seeming to
be well over the age of fifty, with a face that is a
pure mixture of equal parts amusement and mis-
chief. The man notices you and manages to choke out
mid sprint, “Best be on your way!.” He coughs twice, a puff of
black smoke escaping each time.

He stops before your feet and dusts himself off along with
squelching the flames behind him, before he continues on to
say, “Dragons are not to be fooled around with,... ” Another
cough, another black wisp.

He chuckles and looks up at you with a childish grin, full of
satisfaction, “nothing worse in this world than their hot,
stinky breath.”

With those final words, the man wanders off, as if nothing
extraordinary had just transpired, and you are left there alone
to choose the path that you will follow.

### He Who Took the First Steps
There are many tales regarding the first blue traveler, some of
which paint him as a hero whom wandered the world fighting
monsters with their own power. Other tales say he was a
sailor of sorts who was known by every barwench in every
brothel across the seas. Many speak of his courage, his
willingness to walk alone into the darkest dungeons, and his
uncanny knack for making it out alive. It is believed by most
that this man went by the name of Fharlanghn, the God of
Roads, horizons and travelling.

Whether it be for their own desires, or a pilgrimage of sorts
for those who wish to pay homage to Fharlanghn, blue
travelers take to the road in honor of these tales of adventure
and exploration. It is for these reasons that they are treated
like clerics in a way when visiting a shrine to Fharlanghn,
which can be found at most crossroads and oases.

### Wayward Rover
Blue travelers take the term "adaptive learner" to an entirely
new level. They are mages who have mastered the art of
using magic to "mimic" the spells and special actions that
have struck them. Be it the humble cure wounds spell or even
the fiery breath of a dragon, these travelers have learned how
to copy them all. As long as they're willing to stand in the face
of peril, the blue travelers repertoire will continue to grow. In
pursuit of this growth the traveler must seek dangerous foes,
thus creating a cycle by which a life full of memorable
experiences is fabricated.

Many during their traveles tend to train in basic melee
combat, which caters to their up-close and personal style.
While others on the contrary prefer a life dedicated to
knowledge, these travelers forgo their martial training in
exchange for greater spellcasting abilities. There are even
quiet rumors of gun-bearing, blue-coat wearing, seafarers
who sail under flags marked with the holy symbol of
Fharlanghn.

### A Love for Adventure
Usually blue travelers are lone wanderers, they prefer it that
way so as to not jeopardize others for their own desires.
However, every once in a blue moon a traveler may happen
across a bard whom they will travel alongside of due to
common interests and appreciation for eachothers crafts.

Besides this most of the time a blue traveler finds themself
with a group of fellow adventurers through happenstance like
being thrust into battle alongside them, or being hired for a
job requiring multiple adventurers.

No matter how it happens, any group who shares the love for adventure that a
blue traveler has will likely welcome a blue traveler on
account of the carefree, joyous atmosphere they tend to
emanate, and their abundance of knowledge about the world
and it's dangers that they bring to the table.

### Creating a Blue Traveller
If you are starting at a level greater than 1, you should ask
your DM to assign you some starting spells or special actions
so you are not a blank slate.

#### Quick Build
You can make a blue traveler quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability
score. Make Constitution your next-highest ability score and
make either Dexterity or Strength your third highest
depending on your weapon of choice. Second, choose one of
the following backgrounds; Guild Artisan, Outlander, Sage,
Sailor, or make one of your own by following the rules set on
page 125 of the PHB under Customizing a Background.

#### Equipment
You begin the game with 100 gold which you can spend on your character’s starting weapons, armor, and adventuring gear. You can select your own gear or choose one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested Equipment section of your chosen background.

- **Traveling Mage’s Set** (Cost 96 gold): Quarterstaff, Leather Armor, backpack, bedroll, clothes (traveler’s), component pouch, flask of oil, lantern (hooded), mess tin, spellbook
- **Arcane Investigator’s Set** (Cost 91 gold): Dagger, Leather Armor, backpack, 4 candles, chalk, clothes (common), component pouch, spellbook, 2 vials
- **Mage Scholar’s Set** (Cost 89 gold): Quarterstaff, abacus, clothes (fine), ink (1-ounce bottle), ink pen, orb arcane focus, 10 sheets of parchment, sack, spellbook

### Learning from Experience
At 1st level, you gain the ability to magically learn and
recreate special actions and spells that successfully hit you.
But in order for this to work, you must willingly take the hit
and deny any attempt whatsoever to negate its effects. When
you are targeted or in the area effect of a foe's spell or
learnable special action you can choose to fail any saving
throw involved and reduce your AC to 0 for the attack.
Instead you make an Intelligence saving throw against the
casters/users save DC (If the spell or special action has no
DC, it is up to the DM to create a fitting one). If you fail you
can not attempt to learn the same spell or special action until
you have taken a long rest. If you succeed you still take the
full effect of the spell or learnable special action, but you can
add it to your list of known spells or special actions.

Learned special actions can only be actions, bonus actions,
reactions, or legendary actions. They cannot be listed as a
Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack. And they must directly
target, or include the blue traveler in its area of effect. 
\page

Foe abilities that cast a spell are treated as spells for the purpose
of learning. Blue travelers can learn spells of a higher level
than they can cast, but they won't be useable until they can
cast spells of that level, however they cannot learn spells that
require a ritual as they cannot cast rituals.

Learned legendary
actions are used by spending a normal action, no matter what
the cost of using it was to the original creature.
If a special action you are attempting to learn has a
multiple choice of effects (such as a beholders
Eye Ray), you can only learn the effect you were
hit by.

Following with the same example, even
though a creature such as the
beholder can make three attacks
with an Eye Ray using a single
action, you may only make
one. (In very niche situations
where an special action would
seem weak without making
multiple attacks, your DM may rule
otherwise.)

The process of learning from experience
happens between the time when damage
is dealt and before any conditions are
applied, so if a spell or special action
were to attempt to inflict a condition
(such as unconscious, petrified,
charmed, etc.), and you are able to
recover from said condition, you
will do so having learned the spell
or special action if you succeeded on
your learning attempt.


<div class="descriptive">
Special Action is a keyword used only in the blue
traveler class. Special action refers to any action,
reaction, bonus action, or legendary action that the
blue traveler is capable of learning. Using this
keyword in-game can alleviate the interuption in
game flow that comes from not knowing which
actions are special actions. For instance, when a
creature attempts to use a learnable action, the DM
can simply announce, "The dragon uses its special:
action, reaction, legendary action, etc, to use fire
breath." So without needing to ask, the blue
traveler will know if he can learn the action or not.
</div>

### Mimic Spellcasting
You can use any spell you have memorized without
preparation, but you must use all components required to
cast spells unless otherwise stated. Any metamagic, feat
enhancements, or other effects made in the spell when it was
learned will not be replicated when you cast them.

#### Spell Memory
You have spell memory that expands de-
pending on your level. The Blue Traveler
table shows how much memory
you have with which you can fill
by learning spells. You can unlearn
any spell you have learned before
to free up space but must learn
the spell by getting hit by it all
over again if you do. Consigning
a spell to oblivion is a severely
stressfull task that requires 1
hour per forgotten spell, during
this hour you are under severe
mental strain and are unable
to rest.

#### Spell Slots
The Blue Traveler table shows how many
spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of
those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast
one of your mimicked spells of 1st level or higher, you must
expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest. For example, when you are 5th level,
you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast
it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your blue traveler,
so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blue traveler
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<div style="text-align:center;">
	
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier
	
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier
</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your blue traveler spells.

#### Preparing and Casting Special Actions
Using your mimicry magic you are able to mirror the effects
of other creatures special actions much like casting any other
spell. As a blue traveler you have an unlimited memory for
special actions. It is your job as a player to keep track of
said special actions.

All special actions require a Verbal component to cast.
Whenever a special action you cast asks you to make an
attack or set a DC, refer to your spellcasting ability.

After casting a special action you lose your capacity to do
so again until you successfully recharge it. At the start of each
of your following turns, roll a d6, a result of 5-6 recharges
your special action casting class feature. This replaces any
innate recharge function attached to a special action when
you learn it. You can cast a number of special actions equal to
your Intelligence modifier, this amount resets after a short or
long rest.

You prepare the list of special actions that are available for
you to cast. To do so, choose a number of special actions
from your memory equal to your Intelligence modifier + your
proficiency bonus. Casting the special action doesn’t remove
it from your list of prepared special actions. You can
change your list of prepared special actions when you
finish a long rest.

\page

### Traveller's Path
At 2nd level, you come to a fork in the road where you
must make the life long decision of which path you
will travel. Three paths present themselves; the Path
of Enlightenment, the Path of Martial Prowess, and
the Path of the Gun Mage. All of which are detailed at
the end of the class description. Your choice grants
you features at 2nd level, then again at 3rd, 5th,
9th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Miles to Go Before We Sleep
Beginning at 2nd level, when traveling, you motivate yourself
and your companions to move at a faster pace than usual.
When calculating travel speed, add 100 feet per minute, 1
mile per hour, or 6 miles per day to the normal speeds given
in the PHB on page 182 under the Travel Pace table. When
moving towards dangerous situations (DM's discretion
advised) you double this effect.

### Ease of Mind
At level 3 you become more adept at learning thus you may
double your proficiency bonus on Intelligence saving throws
made when trying to learn.

### Natural Demeanor
At 3rd level your connection to the natural world comes forth and becomes omnipresent. Choose one of the following:

#### A Way with Animals
Beasts understand anything you verbally communicate in Druidic, and you can comprehend them in return. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they have perceived within the past day. At the Narrator’s discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks.

#### First-hand Naturalist
You’ve learned the intricacies of nature through firsthand experience rather than academic study. 

You gain an expertise die on Nature checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Nature checks. 

#### Leyline Awareness
Druidic rituals attune you to the leylines that course through the Material Plane. While you are on the Material Plane, you always know the following information:

Which way is north.

The direction of the nearest forest.

The direction of the nearest natural body of water.

The direction of the nearest city or other humanoid community.

The general health of the local ecosystem, and if anything unnatural or magical is upsetting the natural order.

#### Scholar of Old Ways
Your circle taught the old magic at the root of all things, granting you eldritch insights beyond mundane arcane studies.

You gain proficiency with Arcana, or if you already have proficiency you instead gain a specialization. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Arcana checks. 

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20
using this feature.

You can forgo taking this
feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Analyze
At level 6, you may use your action to make a relevant
Intelligence check (Arcana, History, Nature, Religion,
Investigation)(DC = 12 + target's challenge rating (to a
maximum of 30) to learn some helpful information about a
creature's race (weaknesses, resistances, and special actions).
To do so you must have a clear line of sight to the creature. If
you fail you can not attempt to Analyze the same target for
the next 24 hours.

### Traveller's Lore
At 7th level, your knowledge of the natural world grows. Choose one of the following:

#### Druidic Secrets
You’re adept at covertly performing magic without attracting attention. You can speak Druidic if you couldn't already. When you cast a spell you may choose to do so utilizing silent and subtle Druidic motions and signs in place of both the spell’s seen and vocalized components, gestures that creatures which can speak Druidic are aware of. Once you cast a spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest .

#### Toxin Intuition
You are a veteran of nature’s chemical warfare. You automatically know if any flora or fauna is poisonous or venomous. In addition, you gain advantage on checks made to determine if a foodstuff is poisonous and saving throws against poison.

\page
#### Truthspeaker
You’ve learned to tap into the fundamental truth that connects all things, at least briefly.

You may cast the spell legend lore without expending a spell slot and without material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again for the next 24 hours.


#### Waste Not
With 10 minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and has died within the last hour. If sold to a collector, naturalist, or other druid, this notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5 × the creature’s CR.

### Veteran Student
Weathered blue travelers who reach 6th level tend to develop
techniques that help them survive when trying to "learn" a
new spell or special action. Once per short rest you can
choose to be treated as though you have resistance to
damage from a spell or special action that you are attempting
to learn.

Furthermore, when you are afflicted with a condition after
attempting to learn a new spell or special action, you gain
advantage on any subsequent saving throw made to end or
stave off an effect.

### Intercept
Starting at 7th level, as a reaction you can opt to jump in the
way of an incoming effect which threatens an ally, becoming
the new target of the effect. You can do this only when a
creature attempts to make a weapon or spell attack or
declares that an ally must make a Dexterity saving throw.

There must be at least a 5 ft. square of space between the
enemy and the target (either the ally for an attack or the
targeted point for an AOE) for you to move into and the
distance traveled by you can not be greater than 10 feet. You
must decide whether to use this feature before the attacker
determines whether or not the attack has succeeded.

After interposing yourself between the two, you either
become the new target of the effect (and the ally is safe) or
the effect becomes centered on you (and your ally gains 3/4
cover against the effect). Note that, if applicable, you may now
attempt to learn this effect through normal means.

### Fearless Fare
Your line of work requires that you put yourself in harms way
to further your own progress. To be a blue traveler is to never
hesitate in times of desperation, to carry on without worry or
fright. At level 10 you become immune to all fear effects.

<div style="margin-top:40px">
	
</div>

### For the Sake of Learning
The most skilled blue travelers have gained the ability of
resisting death in order to satisfy their curiosity for the most
dangerous special actions. Beginning at level 10, once per
long rest, if you are brought to 0 hp by a spell or special
action which you are attempting to learn, you can instead, if
you succeed on the learning attempt, drop to 1 hp and learn
the spell or special action.

### Vigorous
Blue travelers become naturally more resilient as they expose
themselves to more situations. At level 13, your hit point
maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level.
Whenever you gain a level thereafter, your hit point maximum
increases by an additional 2 hit points. (This bonus stacks
with the bonus granted by the Tough feat.) Additionally
whenever you roll your hit dice to regain hp you may add 2 to
the result.

### Spell Study
At 7th level, you learn to hone your magic and spells to new power levels thanks to your dedicated studies. Choose one Spell Study that reflects what you have dedicated your arcane studies to. 

#### Arcane Objects
When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when hit by it, you are immediately aware that it’s magical. If you hold such an item in your hand, you can cast identify on it as an action without spending a spell slot, even if you don’t have the spell prepared. 

In addition, when you cast identify using a spell slot or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is cursed , and the Narrator will give you a hint as to the curse’s effects (which may be cryptic and vague, but must not be a lie).

#### Detective Spell Study
You are adept at sensing magic and its effects. If there are active magical effects near you, such as a spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, you automatically sense its presence. You don’t know what spell effects there are or where they are, but you can automatically sense the effect of magic in a 20-foot radius around you. 

In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add detect magic and detect thoughts to your spellbook if they weren’t already there. Whenever you cast detect magic , the range that you can sense magic is increased to 60 feet. Whenever you cast detect thoughts , the range of creatures that you can read thoughts from is increased to 60 feet.

#### Fauna and Flora
Your research into plants, wildlife, and the natural workings of magic grants you superior insights into the magic of living creatures and flora.

\page

When a plant or beast makes a saving throw against a spell that you cast, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage .

### Save the Queen
Beginning at level 15, twice per short rest, after successfully
using intercept, you may immediately use the spell or special
action you just blocked against the opponent who cast it. To
do this you must make a concentration check, the DC is
created by the attack you intercepted. In this very unique case
you do not need to have learned the spell or special action to
use it.

When you send the attack back at the caster, the attack roll,
or save DC is set by your spellcasting ability.

You can not use save the queen if the attack you
intercepted causes you to have a condition which restricts
you from taking actions.

### Far and Wide
At level 17, you've picked up a few things having experienced
so much of the world in your travels. Choose two of the
following background features that you do not already have,
the details of which can be found on **pages 125-139** of the
**PHB**:

**Acolyte, Shelter of the Faithful.** For the traveler who has
taken to the following of Fharlanghn, the God of Roads,
horizons and travelling.

**Folk Hero, Rustic Hospitality.** For the traveler who has
taken to the roads so that they may fight to defend troubled
towns, and make their name known.

**Guild Artisan, Guild Membership.** For the traveler who
frequents the travelers guild, and takes their job of mapping
never before seen lands seriously.

**Hermit, Discovery.** For the traveler who has stumbled
accross a great finding, or those looking to help the DM with
a plot hook.

**Outlander, Wanderer.** For the traveler who is good at what
they do.

**Sage, Researcher.** For the traveler seeking to learn a great
magic.

**Sailor, Ship's Passage.** For the traveler who has earned
their sea legs.

### Endless Journey
Upon reaching level 20, once per short rest, through sheer
force of will to continue your journey, you gain the ability to
open a doorway to another plane of your choice.

You conjure the doorway linking an unoccupied space you
can see within 60 ft. to a location on a different plane of
existence, the location can be as broad or precise as you
determine it to be. The doorway can only be seen and used by
creatures you have designated, it's size is undefined making
any size creature capable of passing through. The doorway
lasts 12 hours.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent this doorway
from being created in their presence.

This doorway can also be used by you to make passage to
Journey's End once a year, details on Journey's End can be
found under Extras after the class archetype descriptions.

### Field Studies

#### Calls of the Wild
Using verbal and nonverbal cues to communicate with beasts, you can gain basic information from them or make a simple request (like delivering a short message or small object). 

#### Eidetic Memory
Your memory is nearly perfect. You can accurately recall anything you’ve read or seen in the past month. Additionally, when retreading a travel route you’ve traveled in the past month, you have advantage on ability checks made against environmental hazards on that route, unless the landscape has been significantly altered in that time.

#### Expert Foraging
Once between long rests , you can take 1 minute to collect a number of edible, non-poisonous plants and grubs equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can use its action to eat up to 5 plants or grubs, each of which restores 1 hit point and constitutes 1 Supply. The grubs die and spoil 1 hour after being collected.

#### Loremaster of Creatures
You are well-studied on naturally occurring creatures of the world. When you choose this study, choose one creature type: beasts, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, oozes, plants, or undead. This creature type becomes your Loremaster Creature Specialty. When you encounter a creature of the same type as your Loremaster Creature Specialty, you automatically know any history, legends, or myths related to it. 

#### Loremaster of Travel
You are well-travelled and well-studied. You have advantage on History checks to recall information relating to myths and legends that are location-based. In addition, when you arrive at a settlement for the first time, choose one of the following subjects: culture, etiquette, government, or populace. The Narrator will give you a useful fact about that subject. You can take an expertise die on ability checks related to that subject in this settlement.

#### Mage Hunter
When tracking a creature that can cast at least 1 spell, you can attempt to do so by focusing on the mystic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use your Charisma for any ability checks made to track it.

\page

#### Monster Mimic
By imitating how a beast or studied adversary sounds, looks, and moves, you gain advantage on Deception and Intimidation checks made to convince a creature that it is seeing or hearing that beast or studied adversary.

#### Mountain Climber
You gain a climbing speed equal to your Speed. You gain an expertise die on any Athletics checks made while climbing and you are also acclimated to high altitudes, including elevations above 20,000 feet. In addition, you ignore the effects of roughing it imposed by resting in rocky or uneven terrain.

#### Read the Room
By spending 10 minutes observing facial expressions, body language, and vocal intonation, you can detect minute details which give you insight into the creatures within 30 feet of you. For the next minute, you can direct your focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts.

#### See the Unseen
*Prerequisite: 5th level*

Once between long rests you can focus your attention on peripheral sights, sounds, and other signs of unseen passage. For the next hour, you can detect invisible creatures and objects, their location, movement, and actions, and even sense creatures and objects in the Ethereal Plane.

#### Survivalist
When traveling you may undertake two journey activities instead of one. Both activities must be from the following list: Befriend Animal, Harvest, Hunt and Gather, Scout.

\page
## Traveller's Paths
To survive the deadly situations that they are prone to, a blue
traveler must further develop their combat techniques. They
do so by specializing in a field that resonates with them. The
most common pursuit is the study of spellcasting, closely
followed by melee combat training, and lastly, and much
more scarceley, instruction in the use of firearms.

{{classTable,decoration,frame
##### Traveller's Paths
| Path 					  | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------:|
| Path of Enlightenment| Specialize in Magic|
| Path of the Gun Mage| Specialize in ranged combat|
| Path of Martial Prowess| Specialize in melee combat|
}}

### Path of Enlightenment
Your journey leads you down a path of otherwise
unobtainable knowledge aswell as broadened mental
capabilities. Blue travelers who follow this path tend to be the
most scholarly amongst their peers, they find joy in the
wonders of magic and the inner-workings of the mind. In
addition to improving your intellect and magical prowess, you
learn skills useful for delving into the minds of others,
reading their thoughts, and feeling what they feel (physically
aswell as emotionally).

#### Acute Mind
Upon choosing this archetype at level 2, whenever you spot a
creature casting a spell, you may use your reaction to make
an Arcana (arcane magic) or Religion (divine magic) check in
an attempt to know the exact spell they are casting. The DC
is set by the casters spell save DC. If you succeed your
reaction is refunded.

#### Profound Thinker
When you choose this archetype at level 2, you gain the ability
to learn 4 cantrips. Furthermore, you gain proficiency in all
Intelligence checks, if you already have proficiency in a check,
your proficiency is instead doubled for that check.

#### Arcane Recovery
At 3rd level, whenever you finish a short rest, you regain up to twice the spellpoint cost of the maximum spell level you can cast.

#### Sympathy
Starting at level 5, an amount of times equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) per long rest, you can bind
yourself to a willing creature you wish to learn through for 1 + Intelligence modifier turns as a bonus action.

While bound anything which effects the creature, effects
you as well, damage and healing is split with you evenly
(before any damage reduction), allowing you to learn
whatever it was that was used on your bonded creature.

Furthermore, when bound to a creature this way, your
emotional state changes to that of the bound creature.

#### Split Mind
At 9th level, once per short rest, you can concentrate on two
spells at once. If while concentrating on two spells you must
make a concentration check, you make a seperate check for
both spells. If you attempt to cast a third concentration spell,
both of your current concentration spells end, and the effect
of split mind is lost.

#### Expanded Mind
At 11th level, your ability to mirror spellcasting begins to
magnify allowing you to cast a very limited amount of higher
level spells. At this level you can cast one 6th-level spell
without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest
before you can do so again. You gain one 7th-level spell use at
14th level, one 8th-level spell use at 16th level, and one 9th-
level spell use at 18th level. You regain all uses when you
finish a long rest.

Additionally, your spell memory begins to develop further,
starting at this level you can remember 1 extra spell
(Maximum 11), this development happens again at level 13,
level 15, level 17, and level 19 (Maximum 15).

#### Comprehension
At 14th level you may use any spell scroll without having the
spell memorized and may now learn a spell simply by reading
it from a wizards spell book or a corresponding spell scroll.
Additionally, you gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

#### Manipulation
At 18th level, once per short or long rest, you can reach out
with your mind to read a creature’s thoughts. You can then
use your access to the creature’s mind to command it. As an
action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of
you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is
set by your Spell save DC). If the creature succeeds on the
saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again for 24
hours. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current
emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is
within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During
that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast
the suggestion spell on the creature by expending a spell slot.
The target automatically fails its saving throw against the
spell.

### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.
Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting
Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose
again.

#### Close Quarters Shooter
You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

#### Gunnery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with firearms.
(This bonus does not stack with that of the archery fighting
style.)

#### Run and Gun
When you use the attack action to make only ranged attacks
you can use your bonus action to take the dash action. When
dashing in this manner your speed only increases by one half
of your normal speed.

At level 3 you can channel a magical effect through a bullet.
With a bonus action you can sacrifice a number of spell points that would be equivalent to a spell slot for the day
to imbue your next attack with a firearm with elemental
damage. This attack is considered magical.

You can tailor the effects by making a single choice from
both of the following tables. You can also choose to roll
randomly on one or both of the tables, doing so increases the
DC of the saving throw by 1 for each randomizer dice
(maximum 2) due to the unpredictable nature of your attack.
Creatures who are within the area of effect of this attack
must make a Dexterity Saving throw to take half damage, the
target of the attack does so with disadvantage if he was hit by
the original firearm attack. You use your spell save DC to set
the DC for this attack.

These effects happen whether or not the original firearm
attack successful hits its target.

a firearm, you can expend your bonus action to make a single

once per short rest, you can double the range of the area of
effect of your blue bullet.

closest hostile creature to the original target, the second
target must also be within your line of fire, if there is no
second target available this has no effect.

For the Line AoE, the line extends past the intended target
doubling the orginal distance traveled.

## Path of Martial Prowess
Your journey leads you down a path wrought with direct
confrontational combat. Blue travelers who take this path are

# Cavalier

An elf directs her mount, a sleek black panther,
towards her target, a rampaging ogre. As they
approach, she lowers her great spear just
before it slams devastatingly into the ogre's
thigh, sending it sprawling to the ground.
His allies routing, an armored knight atop a
winged wyvern, swoops down to the battlefield.
He raises his banner to the sky, shouting a heartening
battlecry. The nearby warriors, bolstered by the sight of the
standard, turn back to face their enemy once more.
Seeing the oncoming, rampaging orcs, a dwarvish warrior
plants his pike into the ground, bright heraldric ribbons
flowing from its shaft. He draws his axe as his comrades
assemble around him, empowered by his valiant bravery and
inspiring heraldry.
When one speaks of great heroes of legend, atop a beautiful
steed, weapon in hand, they are speaking of cavaliers. Known
for their encouraging presence and unique, rousing heraldry,
these great warriors enter the battlefield atop a loyal mount,
whether it be a stallion, a wyvern, or anything in between.
The heart of cavaliers, though, is their ability to bolster their
allies, inspiring them to unleash their full potential.

### Heroic Chivalry
Cavaliers are trained warriors, proficient in the use of a
variety of weapons and armor. They pride themselves in their
martial prowess, but even more so in their honor and
heroism. Cavaliers are known for their bravery, taking the
battlefield quickly and decisively on top of their loyal mount.
Most importantly, cavaliers are natural leaders, who inspire
their allies with their charisma, allowing them to fight with
greater heroism and bravery. A cavalier's true might is not
only found in their own strength, but the strength they rouse
in their comrades.

### Honorable Campaign
Cavaliers set off on adventure to seek glory and honor.
On their adventures, cavaliers will often try to be
heroes, attempting to prove their honor, bravery,
mercy, or some other heroic attribute in whatever
challenges they encounter. Because of this,
cavaliers bravely lead the charge against whatever
terrible monsters or villains that stand in their way
or threaten their allies.

In an adventuring party, cavaliers engage
enemies in melee to take the focus off
of their allies. However, cavaliers are rarely
stationary, preferring to use their superior
mobility granted by their mount to control
the battlefield and hit the enemy where it
will hurt the most. Cavaliers also make
the most of heraldry and banners to
inspire allies and dismay foes, using their
great heroism and charisma to win the
battle of morale.

### Creating a Cavalier
One important question to consider for your cavalier is how
you gained their martial skills in combat. Were you a noble
who received formal mounted combat training? Are you a
self-taught warrior? Maybe a retired cavalier passed
knowledge onto you and trained you?
Also, consider the nature of your mount. Determine the
type of creature you would like as your mount, then look at
the options in the "Mount Archetypes" section following the
main class features. Next, determine how you earned the
loyalty of your mount. Was it given to you as part of your
training? Did you happen upon an injured creature and
nursed it back to health? Or did you simply purchase it from a
breeder/trainer?
Lastly, consider the nature of your heraldric banner which
you gain the benefits of at 2nd level. Determine what type of
object your banner is. It could be an actual standard, a
decorative pennant attached to your weapon, emblazoned
armor, or any displayable object that can uniquely designate
you. Also, determine how you obtained your banner. Did you
inherit it by birthright, passed down through your noble
lineage? Is it a simple warbanner roughly made to rally your
allies in combat? Or is it some trinket or article of clothing
that has inadvertently begun to symbolize you?

#### Quick Build
You can make a cavalier quickly by following these
suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest
ability score, followed by Charisma and Constitution. Second,
choose the noble background. Third, choose the equine
nature for your
mount.

#### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**: To qualify for multiclassing with the Cavalier
class, you must meet these prerequisites: 13 Strength or
Dexterity and 13 Charisma 
<br>
**Proficiencies**: When you multiclass into the
Cavalier class, you gain the following
proficiencies: Light armor, medium armor,
shields, simple weapons, and
martial weapons.

<div style="margin-top:80px;"></div>

### Fighting Style
At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even
if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no
other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that
weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two
hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even
if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you,
within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction
to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your
proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be
wielding a shield or a weapon to use this reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you
that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to

### Combat Maneuvers
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in Spirited Steed and one combat tradition from the following list: Adamant Mountain, Sanguine Knot, Tempered Iron, Tooth and Claw. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Cava;oer table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

\page

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Charge
At 2nd level, you valorously charge
towards enemies, using your speed to
deal devastating blows. When you
move at least 15 feet directly towards a
creature, your next melee attack that
targets that creature on your turn deals an
extra 1d4 damage on a hit. This damage also applies for the Charge, Trample and Wheeling Charge maneuvers from the Spirited Steed tradition.

The extra damage changes as you gain
cavalier levels, as shown in the Valor Die column
of the Cavalier table. You do not need to be mounted
to benefit from this feature.

### Heraldric Banner
At 2nd level, you create or otherwise earn heraldry unique to
you, emblazoned on a banner. This banner may be a standard
attached to you or your mount, a pennant flowing from your
weapon, or possibly an emblazoned cloak, tabard, or helm.
You can have the banner attached to you or your mount. Also,

boldness and aggressive tactics. These cavaliers are prepared
for a fight, ready to charge at a moment's notice. Their
fearless tactics frighten even the most experienced foes
causing them to freeze or rout.

The Lion is an obvious symbol for this order due to its
strength, predatory aggression, and natural intimidation.
Some cavaliers in the order seem to emulate these terrible
beasts in their battle cries and charges

#### Lion Edicts
- Hesitation is death; be swift and resolute in your choices.
- The best defense is a bold response.
- Do not allow fear to sway your actions

### Banner of the Lion
Beginning at 3rd level, your banner galvanizes nearby allies to
make bold, demoralizing attacks, granting it the following
effect:

**Banner of the Lion**. When you or an allied creature within
30 feet of your banner hits with a melee attack, they gain a +1
bonus to AC until the beginning of their next turn (maximum
bonus of +2)

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

### Unnerving Boldness
Beginning at 3rd level, your brave demeanor and strategies
unnerve your foes. You gain proficiency in intimidation (or choose between a specialty in intimidation or pick
another cavalier class skill if already proficient).

### Lion's Roar
Beginning at 7th level, your battlecry
envigorates your allies. Once per short rest,
when you deal charge damage, you may use
your bonus action to call allied creatures within 60
feet to join you. Until the beginning of your next turn,
these creatures gain the following benefits:
- Their movement speed increases by 10 feet.
- Once per turn, they can deal extra damage equal to your
valor die when they hit with an attack.

### No Hesitation
Beginning at 11th level, you never hesitate in the face of
danger. You gain an expertise die to initiative rolls.

### Marshal the Pride
Beginning at 15th level, like a lion's pride, you and your allies
attack together with devastating effect. Once per long rest,
when you use the lion's roar feature, you can choose to have
the effects last for one minute.

### Ferocious Assault
Beginning at 18th level, your attacks evoke a deep, primal
fear in your foes, granting you the following benefits:
- When you hit a creature with a melee attack, all hostile
creatures within 10 feet must make a wisdom saving
throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma
modifier). On a failed save, the creature is frightened of
you for one minute. A frightened creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on a success. On a successful save, a creature is
immune to this effect for 24 hours.
- When you kill a creature on your turn, you can take an
additional action on top of your regular action that turn.
You can do this a number of times equal to your charisma
modifier before completing a long rest.

## Order of the Rose
he Order of the Rose is dedicated to preserving peace and
life throughout the land. They seek to resolve conflicts
peacefully wherever possible, but don't hesitate to draw their
blade to defend innocent life when necessary.
\page

The emblem of choice for this order is the rose. Beautiful
and pure, roses remind their beholders of the beauty of life.
But just as a rose has thorns, these cavaliers will strike back
at those who threaten to pluck that life.

#### Rose Edicts
- Wherever possible, find peaceful resolutions
for a conflict.
- Honor the life of all beings; taking life can
never be done lightly.
- Stop those who threaten the lives of the innocent.

### Banner of the Rose
Beginning at 3rd level, your banner gives the hope of life and
peace to your allies, granting it the following effect:
- **Banner of the Rose**. When an allied creature within
30 feet of the banner is reduced to 0 hit points, they
automatically succeed on one
death saving throw.

### Peacemaker
Beginning at 3rd level, you are skilled at resolving conflict
peacefully and finding the middle ground between opposing
groups. You gain proficiency in persuasion (or choose between either a specialization in persuasion or proficiency in another
cavalier skill if already proficient)

### Inner Peace
Beginning at 7th level, you have mastered internal peace
allowing you to remain patient while enduring pain and
difficulty. Once per short or long rest, when you take damage,
you may choose to reduce the damage taken by an amount
equal to your cavalier level plus double your charisma
modifier.

### Harmonious Resolution
Beginning at 11th level, you are adept at ending combats with
minimal harm by convincing a foe to stand down. This may
take the form of disarming/restraining a foe or proving your
martial superiority causing them to submit.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit point with non-lethal
damage, you may choose to render them incapacitated and
unable to move for 10 minutes, but still conscious. When you
do so, you are invigorated in the nonviolent resolution and
gain temporary hit points equal to your cavalier level. If the
creature regains any number of hit points, they are no longer
incapacitated or unable to move.

### Rose's Thorns
Beginning at 15th level, you recognize and efficiently
vanquish dangerous individuals in order to protect the
innocent. As a bonus action, you can choose a target
creature that has dealt damage since your last turn. Your
attacks deal an extra valor die of damage to that creature
for the next minute.

You can only have one creature selected with this
feature at a time. You can use this feature a number
of times equal to your charisma modifier before
completing a long rest

### Peerless Mediator
Beginning at 18th level, your encouraging presence
and powerful speech diminish your enemies'
conviction and aggression. Your proficiency bonus
is doubled for persuasion checks.
In addition, once per long rest, as a bonus action,
choose any number of creatures that you can see.
For the next minute, those creatures suffer the
following drawbacks:
- When a chosen creature makes a critical hit, it
instead counts as a normal hit.
- Damage dealt by chosen creatures is reduced
by an amount equal to your charisma modifier.
- Chosen creatures must make a charisma
saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your charisma modifier) when they
target an incapacitated creature with an
attack. On a successful save, they target the
creature as normal. On a failed save, they do
not attack and the action, bonus action, or
reaction they used is wasted.

## Order of the Shield
Masters of defense and protective fighting styles, members of
the Order of the Shield dedicate themselves to protecting the
weak and defenseless. Experienced warriors know any force
led by a shield cavalier should not be fought head on.

Cavaliers in this order see themselves as shields to be used
in the protection of others. A shield's job is to take the hit, and
many of these cavaliers would rather suffer a severe blow
than let another creature suffer harm.

#### Shield Edicts
- Above all else, protect the vulnerable.
- Fight on the frontline to cover your allies
and divert your foes.
- A sound defense is the backbone of any plan.

### Banner of the Shield
Beginning at 3rd level, your banner reminds your allies to
keep their defenses up, granting it the following effect:

**Banner of the Shield**. When an allied creature within 30
feet of your banner is the target of an attack roll, they can use
their reaction to increase their AC by 1d4 against that attack
only

\page

### Protective Style
Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a protective style in combat.
You gain the protection fighting style from the fighting style
feature (or another cavalier fighting style if you already have
the protection style).

### Precautionary Defense
At 7th level, you learn to preemptively defend allies that are in
dangerous positions. As a bonus action, choose a creature
within 5 feet. Until the beginning of your next turn, as long
as that creature remains within 5 feet, the next attack
targeting that creature has
disadvantage.

### Intercept
Beginning at 11th level, you are vigilant and swift to guard the
vulnerable. When a hostile creature makes a melee attack on
its turn against another creature, you can use your reaction to
move up to half your speed (or your mount's speed if
mounted) towards the targeted creature. As part of the same
reaction, you use the protection fighting style to impose
disadvantage on the triggering attack.

### Cover Ally
Beginning at 15th level, you fully interpose yourself between
your allies and danger. When you use the precautionary
defense feature to impose disadvantage on an attack, that
attack targets you instead. That attack is made with
disadvantage as normal.

### Guardian of the Innocent
At 18th level, you are renowned for your protective intuition
and unbreakable defensive tactics, granting you the following
benefits:
- When you use your bonus action to perform the
precautionary defense feature, you no longer need to
target a specific creature. Instead, you become the target
of the next attack that targets any allied creature within 5
feet and that attack is made with disadvantage.
- When you use the intercept feature, if the triggering
attacks misses, the attacking creature's turn immediately
ends.

## Order of the Sword
The Order of the Sword dedicates itself to a balanced
practice of chivalry, giving equal consideration to all virtues,
such as courage, honor, and justice. Cavaliers who favor a
tempered approach to their morals fit in well with this order.

The sword is the symbol of choice for the order as it
represents balance. Just as a sword must be properly
balanced, so too must cavaliers balance their virtues and
apply wisdom to each unique situation.

#### Sword Edicts
- Avoid extremism and instead seek a principled
middle ground.
- Use wisdom and a tempered attitude in your
choices and deeds.
- Do not allow one virtue to overshadow others.

### Banner of the Sword
Beginning at 3rd level,
your banner brings
stability and calm to those
in its presence, granting it
the following effect:

**Banner of the Sword**. Once
per round, when a creature
within 60 feet of the banner
makes a roll with advantage
or disadvantage, you may
cause the roll to have neither
advantage, nor disadvantage. You may also negate expertise dice with this feature
This effect does not require
an action.

### Unbiased Perception
Beginning at 3rd level, you do not
allow preconceptions or biases to
cloud your perception. You gain
proficiency in insight or perception (or
another cavalier class skill if already
proficient in both)

### Balanced Charge
Beginning at 7th level, even in an offensive
charge, you do not let your defenses drop. When
you use the charge feature to deal extra damage to
a creature, you gain a bonus to your AC against that
creature's attacks equal to your charisma modifier until the
beginning of your next turn

### Impartial Effort
Beginning at 11th level, you learn to apply yourself in a
steady, sustainable way towards your goals and efforts. If you
are proficient in a skill, you may choose to treat checks using
that skill as if you had rolled a 12 on the d20, instead of
making a roll.

You must choose to use this feature before you make the
roll. You may do this a number of times equal to your
charisma modifier before completing a long rest

### Stable Mind
At 15th level, you master your mind and emotions. You make
intelligence, wisdom, and charisma saving throws with
advantage.

### Exemplar of Balance
Beginning at 18th level, you exemplify perfect balance in
combat, never overextending, yet never hesitating. You gain
the following benefits:
- While you are not incapacitated, critical hits targeting you
are considered normal hits.
- When you make an attack roll, you can treat a roll of 9 or
lower as a 10.

# Disciple
An elven woman strides calmly through
a forest glade, smirking as she subtly
grips her sheathed blade. She closes
her eyes as brigands leap from the
surrounding brush. Before they can
even shout their demands, the woman's
blade makes a wide arc at the group. Each
brigand manages to barely dodge her preemptive strike,
but their movements suddenly stop as they start to draw
their blades. A large wound appears across each of their
torsos where her blade had grazed them, and then they
slump to the ground.

Atop a grassy plateau, a lone human figure stands in total
focus amidst a swarm of hovering spectral blades. Like a
masterful conductor, the figure directs the blades to fluidly
strike the targets painted on the stones around. With a quiet
whisper of pride, the figure recalls the blades before willing
them to fall to dust and blow away with the wind.

A battle rages upon a blood-soaked field overlooked by a
regal keep. In its center, stands a lone battle-worn tiefling
fighting for his life. A pair of hulking spectral arms sprout
from his back, allowing the tiefling to wield four axes at once.
He charges into a group of soldiers, wreathing himself in
flames as the lone figure carves into the enemy line. Each
step taken could be his last, yet the tiefling fights with the
widest of grins.

Although these warriors fight using a diverse range of
extraordinary methods, they are all disciples. Disciples are
defined by their mystical fighting styles and the
introspective focus that gives purpose to their training. For a
disciple, combat is a conduit of self-improvement, and
battlefields exist to test the strength of ideals.

### Masters of Tempo
The key to a disciple's magic prowess is awareness and focus.
Every movement a creature makes causes a small, nearly
imperceptible ripple across elements of the weave of magic.
Using their ideals as an anchor for their focus, disciples
enter a state of utter clarity where they can perceive and
read these ripples, ultimately utilizing the power within
these ripples—called tempo—to fuel their mystical
techniques. As a disciple grows and solidifies their grasp on
their ideals, their ability to maintain this focus increases
drastically, improving their martial abilities.

### Forged Ideals
A disciple's ideals are represented in their fighting style by
the sublime disciplines they follow. While some disciples
discover these paths themselves, others learn them from
masters of the art. Each sublime discipline holds one ideal
above all others, and it serves as the anchor for the tempo
techniques of that discipline. As a result, combat using these
disciplines is a form of self expression and an opportunity to
refine one's philosophy. The danger and rigor of the
battlefield provides the perfect situation to test the disciple's
focus, their understanding of themselves, and their values.

### Born Wanderers
Because of this predisposition towards experience and
conflict, it is rare you'll find a disciple that stays in one place
for too long, or subsisting under the yoke of military
regulation. They are natural wanderers, and tend to flock
towards interesting people that may lead them to greater
challenges and adventures. Such people often prove to be
worthy rivals and life-long friends for the wandering
disciple: the perfect sparks to ignite the flames of inspiration.

### Eternal Students
To a disciple, survival is often secondary to growth. To that
end, you may yet find disciples working as sellswords or
mercenaries in an attempt to find new conflicts to test
themselves. Each and every fight is an opportunity to push
past one's limits, and test not only ability, but also their
willpower and determination. The path of the disciple is one
filled with decision. Each must decide which disciplines to
pursue and which to discard, as the path to perfection is
littered with broken philosophies and weak hearts.

### Creating a Disciple
When you are creating your disciple, the most important
thing to consider is why they fight. For a disciple, fighting is
a means of self-discovery and affirmation. What kind of
lessons have their fights taught them up until this point?
What kind of person or warrior do they strive to be, and how
close to that idealized version of themselves are they? Do
they have a specific person or creature they are trying to
defeat? Or perhaps they are seeking out a new mentor to fill
a gap they feel in their skill or personhood? Consider how
your character would feel when faced with what looks to be
an insurmountable threat, and how they would feel after
losing or defeating it.

Equally important is when your character first began to
notice the flow of tempo around them. Was it something they
always saw, but never realized its significance? Maybe it was
inherited? Or maybe the power was unlocked in a dire
moment of emotional or physical danger? Or did you
eventually come to see the tendrils of tempo through
deliberate training, either alone or under a master or school?
Which discipline did you manifest first, and why? Lastly,
how does your character feel about their power now? How
your character first came upon this magic should influence
how they feel about both it and themselves in relation to it.

\page
#### Quick Build
You can make a disciple quickly by following these
suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest
ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on
weapons that use strength or finesse weapons. Your next-
highest ability score should be Wisdom and then you make
Constitution your third-highest score. Second, choose the
folk hero background.

#### Awakening
Tempo is a transient energy, and it takes a very keen sense to
be able to tap into it. However, how one learns to tap into
this energy can vary greatly, and the manner in which you
unlock your power should reflect how you think about your
abilities and their purpose.

##### Awakenings
| d6 | Awakenings |
|:--:|:----------:|
| 1  | You spent a great deal of your life training under a master of a discipline to gain your sense.|
| 2  | One of your loved ones was murdered in cold blood in front of your very eyes. In that moment, you tapped into that wellspring of anguish, and your senses flared.     |
| 3  | Ever since you could remember, you could feel the coursing ripples of tempo around you.     | 
| 4  | You were an malcontent soldier who awakened when you entered a fated duel with a disciple.     | 
| 5  | Since you were a child, your family groomed you to be the most adept disciple in the land.     | 
| 6  | You went on a quest to find purpose, and in your lonesome introspection, you found the calling of the disciple.     | 

#### Unforgettable Sight
Disciples are natural wanderers, always in search of a new
challenge they can use to hone themselves. Almost every
disciple's wanderlust eventually leads them to some place
that leaves an incredible impression on them. Whether
negative or positive, this impression will help inform some of
the disciple's goals and world views

##### Unforgettable Sights
| d6 | Sights |
|:--:|:----------:|
| 1  |Amidst an ancient ruin, you came upon an ornate fountain. When you looked into its waters, it showed you a pivotal moment from your future.|
| 2  | You decided to climb the highest mountain you knew of and witnessed the world sprawled below you at its peak. In that moment of awe, you made yourself a vow.|
| 3  | You accidentally ventured through a portal to one of the Inner Planes, and you witnessed its denizens defending themselves against a nightmarish threat.| 
| 4  | On a day of clear sky, you bore witness to a swarm of dragons that stretched as far as the eye could see.| 
| 5  | You stood at the historic site of great tragedy, whether it be the remains of a massacre, the felling of a kingdom, or something else entirely.| 
| 6  | You slew or bore witness to the slaying of the last remaining member of a type of magical creature.| 


#### Personal Flourish
Self expression on the battlefield is the lifeblood of disciples,
and as such many disciples develop their own personal
touches to combat or personal philosophies of battle.

##### Personal Flourishes
| d6 | Flourish |
|:--:|:----------:|
| 1  | You call out the names of your signature arts and tempo techniques as you perform them.|
| 2  | You can spin your weapons absurdly fast, and do so in combat or in anticipation of combat.|
| 3  | You have a personal symbol that you place on the bodies of those who you defeat in combat.| 
| 4  | You analyze and copy the martial stances of your opponents without thinking.| 
| 5  | You try to position yourself in front of your allies whenever possible in order to always be in the action.| 
| 6  | You spare enemies you deem fit, in hopes they will grow and challenge you again.|

#### Multiclassing
The prerequisites for multiclassing into a disciple are either
a Strength or Dexterity score of 13 and a Wisdom score of 13.
When you multiclass into disciple, you gain proficiency in
light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and
martial weapons

### Sublime Discipline
A disciple's path begins with learning sublime disciplines. A
sublime discipline is a kind of mystical martial art. Each
discipline is centered on an ideal for the disciple to
understand and internalize.

At 1st level, choose one sublime discipline, detailed at the
end of the class description. When you gain certain disciple
levels, you gain knowledge of new disciplines, as shown on
the Disciplines Known column of the Disciple table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the disciplines you know and replace it with
another discipline.

#### Signature Art
Each sublime discipline has an associated Signature Art, the
foundational ability of the discipline. You can use this feature
to invoke the effects of the Signature Art of a discipline you
know. If you use a Signature Art that has a duration while
already under the effects of a Signature Art, the first
Signature Art immediateley ends.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest

#### Tempo Techniques
Each discipline has a list of techniques─its discipline
techniques─that you gain at the disciple levels noted in the
discipline's description. These techniques require you to
spend tempo points to use which you gain at 2nd level.

Some techniques modify a specific attack. You can only use
one such technique per attack.

#### Tempo Ability
Your ability to utilize tempo is tied your intuition and ability
to perceive the ripples of magic around you; as such, Wisdom
is the key ability for disciples. Some of your discipline
features require for your target to make a saving throw to
resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated
as follows:

\page
<div style="text-align:center;">
	
**Tempo save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
	
**Spell attack modifer** = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
</div>

### Martial Intuition
Your opponents' blows radiate a certain rhythm that your
body has learned to read. If a creature attacks you or forces
you to make a saving throw, your DM tells you one one of the
following things about its capabilities (your choice):

- If one of its ability scores of your choice is higher than,
lower than, or equal to your same ability score.
- If any of its speeds is higher than, lower than, or equal to
a single speed of yours (your choice).
- If their statistics are being altered by a spell or magical
effect.
- If they are proficient in at least one martial weapon.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose a fighting style from the list of optional
features. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more
than once, even if you get to choose again.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no
other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that
weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two
hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even
if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your
ability modifier to the damage of the second Attack.

### Combat Maneuvers
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Mirror’s Glint, Razor's Edge, Tempered Iron, and Unending Wheel. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Disciple table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.


### Tempo
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to perceive and
utilize the power in ambient ripples of magic, called tempo.
Your access to this mystical energy is represented by a
number of tempo points. Your disciple level determines the
number of points you have, as shown in the Tempo Points
column of the Disciple table.

You can spend these points to fuel various tempo
techniques granted by your disciplines. When you spend a
tempo point, it becomes unavailable. When you take the
Dodge action, you can use your bonus action to focus and
regain any expended tempo points

### Battlefield Etiquette
3rd level, you learn the unwritten rules of the battlefield. After you have fought beside (or against) a martial artist for one encounter, you have advantage on Charisma checks against it. Any creature that has a martial arts die, proficiency with a combat tradition, or an exertion pool is considered to be a martial artist.

### Sublime Journey
At 3rd level, you have embarked on a personal journey that
shapes your skills and draws you towards certain innate
magical talents. Choose to follow the Journey of the Blade
Dancer, the Journey of the Conjurer, or the Journey of the
War God. Your choice of Sublime Journey grants you features
at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 14th, and 18th levels.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

### Reserves
At 4th level your stamina increases, allowing you to engage foes longer without tiring. Your exertion pool increases by 1. At 8th, 12th, and 16th level your exertion pool increases by an additional point.

\page

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,

## Sublime Journey
Those who continually practice the use of tempo inevitably
find a force pulling on the core of their being. As one uses
the transient power of tempo, it gradually changes the
wielder's mind, body, and soul, eventually culminating in the
emergence of a mystical ability that defines their journey as
a disciple.

As each disciple's path differs, the time which this force
manifests varies greatly from disciple to disciple. Some train
under masters in an attempt to bring out this ability earlier,
whereas for others, their ability only emerges when they are
faced with truly insurmountable odds.

Whether you choose your sublime journey, or it chooses
you, perfecting all it entails will be one of your greatest
challenges as a disciple

{{classTable,decoration,frame
##### Sublime Journeys
| Journey 				  | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------:|
| Journey of the Blade Dancer  |Specialize Blade Dancing|
| Journey of the Collector    |Specialize using different Weapons|
| Journey of the War God     |Specialize in Spectral Arms|
}}

## Journey of the Blade Dancer
A single swing of the blade is oft more than it appears, and
this is especially true for a disciple that follows the Journey
of the Blade Dancer. Blade Dancers are disciples whose
bodies have all but merged with the ripples around them.
Their newfound magical senses drive them to seek out
flexibility in the execution of their steps and techniques.
Their precise, sweeping motions cut into the fabric of magic
itself, infusing them with supernatural acrobatic ability and
elegance in battle.

### Blade Dance
When you choose this journey at 3rd level, your strikes are
followed by magical ripples that echo your intent. Whenever
you make a melee weapon attack against a creature and miss,
you can cause the creature to take force damage equal to
your Wisdom modifier.

Additionally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack
against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity
attacks against you for the rest of your turn

### Elegance
Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance
skill if you don't already have it, and can add your Wisdom
modifier to ability checks that use that proficiency.

<div style="margin-top:40px"></div>

### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the
way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning
breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect
that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on
the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Accelerando
At 11th level, you add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1)
to the damage of your melee weapon attacks. Additionally,
you can take the Dash action as a bonus action

### Rushing Agility
At 14th level, your mastery of the weight of your body allows
you to defy natural limitation. You can use your remaining
movement to determine the maximum distance you can jump
(long or high), instead of the normal calculation. You can
jump your full distance with or without a running start.

Additionally, you can move along vertical surfaces and
across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

### Free Stride
At 18th level, your movements become impossible to stop.
Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells
and magical effects can't reduce your speed or cause you to
be paralyzed or restrained. You can spend 5 feet of
movement to automatically escape from nonmagical
restraints. Additionally, being underwater imposes no
penalties on your movement or attacks.

## Journey of the Collector
Most often the Journey of the Conjurer begins with a
recurrent dream of an infinite field littered with weaponry
from across the ages. Within this space you are free to use
and manipulate, form and reform the weaponry and
landscape as you see fit, perpetually in pursuit of the perfect
arsenal. This dream repeats, becoming more and more lucid
until you awaken amidst a cloud of flying armaments that
flow along to your whims, and from that day each weapon
you touch, and each alteration you make in your dreams, will
reflect in your control over your magical arsenal.

### Bound Arsenal
Starting when you choose this journey at 3rd level, you learn
to call upon an arsenal of weapons you store within your
mind. You must bind weapons to yourself in order to call
upon them.
\page
If you hold a weapon and meditate for 1 hour
over the course of a short or long rest, you can bind the
weapon to your arsenal, causing it to disappear. When you
summon your arsenal, this weapon is summoned within it
while it is bound.

You can have a number of weapons bound this way equal
to your Wisdom modifier plus your disciple level. A weapon
becomes unbound 24 hours after you die or unbind it with an
action, causing it to appear within 5 feet of you. Sentient
weapons must agree to be bound, and can choose to unbind
themselves at any point.

### Conjure Weapons
Starting at 3rd level, you can conjure or dismiss your arsenal
of bound weapons, which hover in your space, as a bonus
action. The weapons that are part of this arsenal deal force
damage instead of their normal damage type, and gain the
thrown property range (20/60). Any thrown arsenal weapon
immediately returns to your space after the attack.

Whenever you can make a weapon attack and are not
wielding any weapons or shields, you can instead mentally
direct any single weapon in this arsenal to attack as if you
are wielding it (as if using your choice of one or two hands).

You can engage in two-weapon fighting using the arsenal,
provided the weapons you use meet its conditions.
Additionally, when you conjure these weapons, and as a
bonus action on subsequent turns, you can put the weapons
in one of the following formations:

**Assault**. Your arsenal poises to attack. Ranged attacks
made with your arsenal do not suffer disadvantage due to
attacking at long range or being within 5 feet of a hostile
creature and ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

**Storm**. Your arsenal enters a frenzy. The area within 5 feet of
you is difficult terrain for creatures of your choice.

**Ward**. Your weapons form a protective barrier. The first
time you take damage after the start of each of your turns, it
is reduced by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of 1).

### Blade Affinity
At 7th level, you can read into a weapon's history through
mere touch. Over the course of 1 minute, you can analyze a
weapon you are touching. At the end of the minute, you glean
one of the following things (DM's choice):

- A clear picture of the weapon's last wielder as it drew the
weapon for combat.
- A glimpse of a magical ability the last wielder used while
wielding the weapon.
- Whether the last wielder used the weapon with malicious,
honorable, protective, or some other form of intent.
- A glimpse of the last creature felled by this weapon.

Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until
you finish a short rest or long rest. This process drains the
magical imprint left on the weapon, so once you have used
this feature on a given weapon, you can't use it on that
weapon again until it has seen use in combat.

### Ultimate Arsenal
At 11th level, both your control and the quality of your
arsenal have heightened, causing your formations to
improve:

**Assault**. Any attack made with weapons from your arsenal
deal an additional 1d8 damage.

**Storm**. The weapons expand into the area within 15 feet of
you instead of 5 feet.

**Ward**. The damage is reduced by twice your Wisdom
modifier instead (minimum of 2).

### Conjured Body
At 14th level, you have learned how to merge your body with
your armory, embedding within you its fluid movement.
While you have your arsenal conjured, you gain a flying
speed equal to your walking speed, which manifests visually
as wing-like blades, riding a flying sword, or a similar effect.

### Dream Gate
At 18th level, you can bring out the full force of your arsenal
in an instant. As an action, you create a visage of your field
behind you and conjure 100 weapons all around you. Choose
any number of creatures within 120 feet of you, and divide
100 projectiles among them (a creature can be targeted by up
to 10 projectiles). Each creature must make a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 1d8 force damage for each projectile
launched at it, or half as much on a successful save. These
weapons disappear at the end of your turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a long rest.

## Journey of the War God
A disciple who follows the Journey of the War God is
unmistakable on the battlefield by the manifestation of their
soul fighting alongside them, often taking the form of
spectral arms or a looming figure at their back.

The influence of tempo can reach further than most would
think; after all everything moves, even your own spirit.
Disciples that define themselves by intense emotions, or a
need to prove their own self worth, can develop a sensitivity
to the movements of their soul. After enough time, the
disciple gains the ability to summon and wield this element
of their soul in combat. Legends speak of disciples that attain
definite control, and ultimately learn harness the divine
spark that resides within them.

\page
### Spirit of the War God
When you choose this journey at 3rd level, your passion can
call forth the part of your soul that revels in the glory of
battle. As a bonus action or when you roll initiative, you can
manifest or dismiss two spectral arms that are connected to
your upper body.

When summoned, and on each of your
turns thereafter, each arm can perform an object interaction,
such as drawing a weapon. You can control these arms easily,
and they act just like your other arms.

As an action, you can make a single attack with each melee
weapon you and your spectral arms are wielding (up to 4
attacks). You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of
these rolls, unless that modifier is negative. When wielding a
two-handed weapon, your spirit arms must hold the weapon
with both hands at all times.

At 5th level, you add your ability modifier to the damage
rolls of weapons you are wielding with your hands (up to 2
attacks). At 11th level, you also add your ability modifier to
the damage rolls of weapons your spirit arms are wielding.

### Cosmic Presence
At 7th level, your connection to your inner self has granted
you greater presence. When you make an Intimidation or
Persuasion check, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the
roll instead of your Charisma modifier.

Additionally, as an action, you can amplify your presence a
hundred fold. Creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you
must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your
tempo save DC or become aware of your presence. For the
next 10 minutes, you have advantage on all Wisdom and
Charisma checks made against those creatures.

Once you use this action, you must finish a short or long
rest before you can use it again.

### Encroaching Omniscience
At 11th level, your soul becomes your vigil, as the shapes of
faces can be traced around your head. Whenever you make
an attack as a part of a reaction, you can make an additional
attack with one of your spectral arms.

Additionally, once on each of your turns when you miss
with a weapon attack, you can make an additional weapon
attack with a weapon being wielded by your spectral arms as
part of the same action

### Lens of Truth
At 14th level, your sight ascend towards the sight of gods.
You can see clearly in normal and magical darkness out to
120 feet, as well as into the Ethereal Plane. You can see the
true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by
illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within
this range and within line of sight.

### Shard of Divinity
At 18th level, you have fully reconnected with your soul,
unlocking the divine power within it. You have resistance to
damage from weapon attacks, and any damage you deal with
a weapon attack or tempo technique ignores resistance and
bypasses immunities.

You can no longer die from old age, and your soul cannot
be stolen, trapped or destroyed, nor can you be unwillingly
raised as an undead, except by divine intervention.
\page
## Sublime Disciplines
### Ardent Lion
No true warrior fights in isolation; their friends, family, and
all their allies follow them into every fight. Ardent Lion
disciples fight using rallying cries and by utilizing the
strength of their bonds to perform superhuman feats in
combat.
<br>
**Ideal: Camaraderie**. Your allies are your family, and those
bonds are more precious than anything the world can
muster. Cherish them and look out for them, for they will
make you your best self.
<br>
**Signature Art: Rally**. As an action, you let out a riveting
war cry that sends jolts through the bodies of your allies.

move up to their speed without provoking opportunity
attacks.

5th level (60 feet), 11th level (90 feet), at 17th level (120 feet).

#### Techniques
**Warding Strike (2nd Level)**. When you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action and

<br>
**Bolstering Bond (5th Level)**. As an action, you can spend up
to 5 tempo points to bolster yourself and an ally. You and an
ally of your choice within 30 feet of you gain 1d8 temporary

until you focus to regain your tempo.
<br>
**Unified Assault (11th Level)**. Whenever you hit a creature
with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action
and spend 3 tempo points to call in an assault. A single allied
creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can use their
reaction to make a weapon attack against that same creature.
<br>
**Fury of the Fallen (17th Level)**. Whenever you see a
creature reduce an allied creature to 0 hit points, you can use
your reaction and spend 4 tempo points to move up to your
speed and make an attack against the attacking creature. On
a hit, the attack deals damage as normal and the allied
creature regains hit points equal to your level.

### Coursing Ember
To live life on the sidelines, bored and discontent, is to not
really live life at all. Disciples of the Coursing Ember
discipline are fiery individuals who follow their whims and
passions to the ends of the earth. Coursing Ember techniques
involve spreading radiant flames and gliding through the
battlefield.
<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

**Ideal: Passion**. Your heart must burn like the desert sun.
Do not live idly and let opportunities pass you by. Be
invested in every action you choose to take, and use the fire
in your eyes to guide you into the future.
<br>
**Signature Art: Salamander Charge**. As an action, you
move up to your speed without provoking opportunity
attacks, leaving behind a wall of fire that is 10 feet high and 1
foot thick along your path, lasting for 1 minute or until you
lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a
spell). You can move through creature's spaces for this
movement, but you can't end your turn there. The wall lightly
obscures vision. Any creature in the wall when it first
appears, and whenever a creature enters the wall for the first
time on a turn or ends its turn there, it must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage.

This damage increases to by 1d8 at 5th level (2d8), and
again at 11th, (3d8) and 17th levels (4d8).

#### Techniques
**Searing Lashes (2nd Level)**. You coat your weapons in
searing flames. When you take the Attack action, you can
spend 1 tempo to increase your reach by 10 feet until the end
of your turn. Your attacks deal fire damage instead of their
normal damage type for the duration, and deal an additional
1d4 damage.
<br>
**Leaping Flame (5th Level)**. Whenever you are damaged by a
hostile creature within 60 feet of you that you can see, you
can use your reaction and spend 2 tempo to briefly turn into
a wisp of flame and fly to an unoccupied space within 5 feet
of them without provoking opportunity attacks.
<br>
**Flame's Blessing Stance (11th Level)**. At the start of your
turn, you can spend 2 tempo points to engulf yourself in
beautiful flames. Until the start of your next turn, you are
immune to fire damage, and creatures take 1d8 fire damage
any time they make a melee attack against you.
<br>
**Bursting Sunspot (17th Level)**. When you hit a creature
with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action
and spend 3 to 5 tempo points to cause the target of your
attack to explode in a blaze of glory. Every creature in a 10-
foot radius, increased by 10 feet for every tempo point spent
above 3, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
6d6 fire damage. You are immune to this damage

### Diamond Mind
Students of the Diamond Mind discipline are renowned for
their ability to remain calm in even the most dire of
situations. Combat is an equation to be solved, and it is the
practice of the Diamond Mind to understand all of its
elements. This view lends itself to a prescient combat style,
where the practioner appears able to act in impossibly short
spans of time.
<br>
**Ideal: Order**. Everything has a cause and an effect. The
world may appear chaotic, but a clean layer of order
underlies it all.

\page

The more you discover and understand this
order, the greater a warrior and the more fulfilled an
individual you will become.
<br>
**Signature Art: Quick Draw**. If you are not surprised,
immediately after initiative is rolled, but before anyone acts,
you can move up half your your speed and make a single
weapon attack. This attack deals double damage to objects
and structures.

If you are surprised, you can instead use this signature art
to no longer be surprised.

#### Techniques
**Prescient Counter (2nd Level)**. When you are hit by an
attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 tempo points
to gain an AC bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier against
that attack, potentially causing it to miss.
<br>
**Flicker Step (5th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 3
tempo points and pick a hostile creature within 20 feet of
you. You can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of
that creature, and make a melee weapon attack against any
creature in a 5-foot wide line from your original location to
your new location.

If a creature damaged by this technique has an amount of
hit points less than or equal to your disciple level at the end
of your turn, it drops to 0 hit points.
<br>
**Ruby Storm Stance (11th Level)**. When you take the Dodge
action, you can immediately use your bonus action and spend
1 tempo point to enter a time-slowing stance. Until the start
of your next turn, you can't be knocked prone or moved, and
whenever a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack,
you can instantly make a melee attack against it.
<br>
**Trace (17th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 4 tempo
points to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space within
reach of a target and make a single melee weapon attack
against it. On a hit, this attack deals an additional 2d8 force
damage. You can do this up to 5 additional times as a part of
the same action, so long as each target you attack
is different

### Hero's Charge
The world is full of monsters and those that would exploit
the weak. Hero's Charge disciples take it upon themselves to
become symbols of hope by bringing down great threats for
all to see. The techniques of this discipline focus on refining
an indomitable will and bringing the mighty down.
<br>
**Ideal: Heroism**. People deserve peace and happiness, and
so you take it upon yourself to be a tool for their delivery.
Overwhelming odds are a welcome challenge, for you must
be a beacon of inspiration for as long as there is a soul left to
be saved.
<br>
**Signature Art**: Symbol of Hope. While you can see at
least one ally, and you are reduced to 0 hit points but not
killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature beyond the first after a long
rest, you gain a level of fatigue. When you finish a long
rest, all exhaustion levels gained this way go away.

#### Techniques
**Topple (2nd level)**. You can forgo a weapon attack on your
turn and spend at least 1 tempo point to attempt to topple a
creature within reach. The target must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone and takes
1d8 bludgeoning damage for each tempo point spent. If the
target is Large or larger, it has disadvantage on this saving
throw and instead takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each
tempo point spent.
<br>
**Blinding Courage (5th Level)**. Whenever a creature
attempts to frighten you or a non-hostile creature within 10
feet of you, you can use your reaction and spend 3 tempo
points to make it so every non-hostile creature within 10 feet
of you can't be frightened until the start of your next turn.
<br>
**Revolution (11th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 3
tempo points and make a melee attack against every creature
within 5 feet of you. If any of these creatures is Large or
larger, it takes additional damage equal to your weapon's
damage die.
<br>
**Tyrant's Downfall (17th Level)**. As an action, you can spend
5 tempo points to cause a giant glowing weapon to appear.
This weapon crashes down in a 60 foot-tall, 10 foot radius
cylinder centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of
you. Any creature in the area must make a Charisma saving
throw or take 5d12 radiant damage, or half of that damage on
a success. If a creature is Large or larger, it takes an
additional 2d12 damage. You must concentrate on this effect.

### Howling Gaze
It is too often that people chain themselves to the earth and
become prisoners of a life they never really enjoyed.
Disciples of the Howling Gale put above all else the ability to
decide for themselves their next path. Techniques of this
discipline focus on being hard to reach and pushing back
oppressive advances.
<br>
**Ideal: Freedom.** Life is but a small breeze, fleeting upon
the chaotic winds of the universe. Do not waste it carrying
undue burdens that leave you crushed. Lift these burdens
from yourself and those around you, and reflect on how
much more joyous it is to live free.
<br>
**Signature Art: Gale Surge**. As a bonus action, you whip a
wild gust around your body and briefly become as the wind.
This effect lasts 1 minute, or until you lose concentration (as
if concentrating on a spell). For the duration, you have
advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and whenever a
creature misses you with an attack, you can move 5 feet
without provoking opportunity attacks.

\page

#### Techniques
**Driving Wind (2nd Level).** You can use your action and
spend up to 5 tempo points to unleash a cone of rushing air
from your weapon. The size of the cone is an amount of feet
equal to 10 times the amount of tempo points you spent.
Creatures of your choice in the cone must make a Strength
saving throw or be pushed backwards until they reach an
unoccupied space at the end of the cone. A creature can
choose to fail this saving throw.
<br>
**Wind Scar (5th Level)**. You can use your action and spend
any amount of tempo points to swing your weapon and
unleash a blade of air forward. Pick up to 3 creatures you can
see within 60 feet of you. If you target more than one
creature, each target must be within 5 feet of at least one
other target, and none of them can have cover from you.
Each of these targets must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failure, a creature takes 1d8 magical slashing
damage for each point of tempo you spend, or half as much
on a success.
<br>
**The Wind That Walks (11th Level)**. As a bonus action, you
can spend 3 tempo points to become invisible and able to
move through the space of any creature, as well as through
spaces as small as 1 inch gaps without expending additional
movement until the start of your next turn, or until you
attack a creature or force it to make a saving throw.
<br>
**Tranquil Windstorm (17th Level)**. As a bonus action, you
can spend 3 tempo points to create a 10 foot radius sphere of
whirling air that follows you, which lasts until the end of
your next turn. While within the sphere, creatures of your
choice can ignore difficult terrain, and you can impose
disadvantage on any ranged attack that targets a creature
inside of the sphere. Additionally, if a creature starts its turn
inside the sphere, you can increase its speed by 10 feet until
the end of its turn

### Mercurial Wolf
How can one truly claim to be living when they adhere to the
constraining lines of conventional thought? Disciples of the
Mercurial Wolf discipline value spontaneity and change, and
as such their techniques involve creating complicated and
chaotic situations on the battlefield through illusions and
trickery.
<br>
**Ideal: Chaos**. Stagnation is the enemy of growth, so it is up
to you to make sure that the world is constantly changing.
Adapt to the situations you bring about, and through that act
you will find completeness.
<br>
**Signature Art: Quicksilver Pack**. As an action, you create
an illusory duplicate of yourself. This effect lasts 1 minute
and requires you maintain concentration as if concentrating
on a spell. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space
within 10 feet of you that you can see. A duplicate has the
same AC as you and disappears whenever it takes any
damage from an attack, spell or magical effect. As a bonus
action on your turn, you can move any one duplicate created
by this art up to 30 feet to a space you can see. A duplicate
can only fly this way if you also have a fly speed.
Alternatively, you can use your bonus action to destroy a
duplicate and teleport to its space, provided you can see the
duplicate.

The amount of duplicates you can make with this ability
increases to 2 at 5th level, 3 at 11th level, and 4 at 17th level.

#### Technique
**Mirror Step (2nd Level)**. You twirl the world about a
creature, disorienting its perception of your position. When a
creature moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your
reaction and spend 1 tempo point to force that creature to
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you can
teleport to any space within 5 feet of the creature, and the
next attack it makes against you before the end of the turn is
made at disadvantage.
<br>
**Inversion (5th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 3 tempo
points to force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to
make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you teleport into
a space that creature occupies and cause that creature to
teleport into your space. If there is no room for the you or
the creature where the other stands, this technique fails.
<br>
**Altered Perspective (11th Level)**. When a hostile creature
misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction
and spend 3 tempo points to force that creature to repeat the
same attack against a creature of your choice within range of
the attack (other than itself).
<br>
**Shifting Sides (17th level)**. As a bonus action, you can spend
4 tempo points and attempt to alter a creature's perception of
the battlefield. A creature of your choice within 30 feet of
your must make an Intelligence saving throw to see through
the illusion you foist on it. On a failed saving throw, the
creature can't make reactions until the start of its next turn,
and immediately makes a melee weapon attack against a
creature of your choice within its reach

### Raven's Gaze
An eye for an eye leaves the world blind, but no wrong ever
truly escapes the raven's gaze. Disciples of the Raven's Gaze
discipline allow no slight against them or their compatriots
to go unpunished. Techniques of the Raven's Gaze revolve
around instilling fear in your assailants before bringing
them down.
<br>
**Ideal: Revenge.** You have been wronged. If you haven't
been, you will be. It is your charge to turn your ire upon
those who sought to bring you down, and take from them
that which you are owed. They tried to bring you to your
knees, but now you are hoisted up by the black wings of
vengeance.
<br>
**Signature Art: Will of the Conspiracy.** As a bonus action,
you can force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, the target's vision and hearing is
overtaken by a swarm of ravens. Until the end of your next
turn, it is deafened and perceives the area beyond a 10 foot
radius around it to be magical darkness.

\page

If you start your
turn outside of this radius, you can use your bonus action to
teleport into an unoccupied space inside of it. If a target
succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you
tried to use this art on it.

#### Techniques
**Gaze of the Flock (2nd Level)**. When a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you damages you or forces you to make a
saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 tempo
points to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failure, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
At the end of each of your turns while a creature is
frightened of you in this way, you can spend 1 tempo point to
force the creature to make another Wisdom saving throw. On
a failure, the creature remains frightened of you until the
end of your next turn.
<br>
**Unkindness In Turn (5th Level)**. You can spend your bonus
action and 2 tempo points to teleport to a creature within 30
feet of you that is frightened of you. That creature must
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes
paralyzed with fear until the start of their turn.
<br>
**Futility (11th Level)**. Once on each of your turns when you
hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1
tempo point and have it make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failure, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on saves
against becoming frightened until the end of their next turn.
<br>
**Vengeance of the Swarm (17th Level)**. A black mist of
ethereal ravens surges from you to enact your revenge.
When a creature damages you, you can use your reaction
and spend 4 tempo points to cause that creature to lose hit
points equal to the amount of damage you took (maximum of
40 damage

### Stone Dragon
Like the plates that shift about the world's surface, you leave
a lasting impact on every person you encounter. Followers of
the Stone Dragon discipline put great thought that each
spoken word and each action belonging to them is not glib.
Techniques of the Stone Dragon disciple focus on using the
earth to keep you centered, and landing decisive blows.
<br>
**Ideal: Stoicism.** Expression is a powerful thing that is best
not used frivolously. Speak and act when your words and
actions further your path, and make sure each word strikes
with the impact of a falling boulder.
<br>
**Signature Art: Dragon Sentinel.** As a bonus action, you
cause a Medium dragon statue to emerge in an unoccupied
space within 30 feet of you, lasting for 1 minute or until you
lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
The dragon statue is a magical object that occupies its
space. It has an AC of 13 + your Wisdom modifier, and a
number of hit points equal to twices your disciple level. It is
immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all
conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving
throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). The area within 10
feet of the dragon is considered difficult terrain. As a bonus
action on subsequent turns, you can make the dragon move
up to 15 feet.

If you summon the dragon within 5 feet of a creature, and
as a reaction whenever a creature moves within 5 feet of it,
you can cause the dragon to make a melee spell attack
against that creature. On a hit, it deals an amount magical
piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier, and
their speed is halved until the end of the turn.

#### Techniques
**Roots of the Earth (2nd Level)**. When an effect would
knock you prone or move you against your will, you can
spend 1 tempo point to hook into the earth. Until the end of
your next turn, you can't be be knocked prone or moved
against your will, including against the original effect.
<br>
**Mountain Hammer (5th Level)**. When you hit a creature
with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 tempo points to
embed it into a fissure below it. The target must make a
Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked
prone. If the target is already prone, it is instead restrained
until the end of its next turn.
<br>
**Earthbound (11th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 3
tempo points to petrify yourself until the start of your next
turn. While petrified in this way, any damage you take is
halved, and your form can't be changed.
Additionally, the earth around your feet attempts to encase
those around you. Each creature within 15 feet of you must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, that creature is
restrained until the end of your next turn.
<br>
**Breath of Ages (17th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 5
tempo points to exhale an eroding mist that originates from
either you or your Dragon Sentinel. All creatures in a 60-foot
cone, which spreads around corners, must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's body
becomes heavy and sluggish until the end of your next turn.
For the duration, the creature's speed is halved, and it can't
use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a
bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities
or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged
attack during its turn.

Once per turn, when you hit a sluggish creature with a
melee weapon attack, you can force it to make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes petrified until
the end of your next turn.

### Titan Fury
The path of the warrior is full of rivals and obstacles.
Followers of the Titan Fury discipline make it their goal to
shatter the competition and make it clear that their power is
absolute. Techniques of the Titan Fury discipline focus on
demolishing the weak and cowardly and ripping through
attempts at stopping your advance.

\page


**Ideal: Power.** It is not enough to merely defeat your
enemies; you must overcome them and demonstrate the gap
in your abilities. You must prove to yourself and to the world
that your might is unrivaled.
<br>
**Signature Art: Blood of the Ancients.** As a bonus action,
you can bolster your form. You gain temporary hit points
equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your disciple level,
which last for 1 minute (rounded up, minimum 1).
For as long as you have these temporary hit points,
whenever you make a Strength check or saving throw and
you roll a number below half your Wisdom score on a d20,
you can treat the roll as half your Wisdom score.
Starting at 5th level, for as long as you have these
temporary hit points, your size increases to Large if you are
not already Large or bigger. This means that your size
doubles in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by
eight. Your equipment grows to match your new size. If there
isn't enough room for you to double your size, you attain the
maximum possible size in the space available.

#### Technique
**Power Overwhelming (2nd Level)**. When you hit a target
with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action
and spend up to 5 tempo points. The target is pushed
backwards 5 feet for every point of tempo you spent.
If this movement would force the target to impact a
creature, object, or structure, then it and whatever it collided
with take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet of forced
movement remaining (minimum of no damage).
<br>
**Cull the Meek (5th level)**. Those who seek to mar you
without facing you deserve a swift punishment. When a
creature you cannot see hits you or a creature hits you with
a ranged attack, you can use your reaction and spend 3
tempo points to reduce that damage by 1d10 + your Wisdom
modifier, and then force that creature to succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to the
amount you reduced.
<br>
**Titan's Will (11th Level)**. At the start of your turn, you can
spend 4 tempo points to remove one of the following
conditions from yourself: blinded, charmed, deafened,
frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
<br>
**Arduous Wrath (17th Level)**. As an action, you can spend 4
tempo points and slam your weapon into the earth. Every
creature in a 15-foot cone in front of you must make a
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of
your next turn

\page
# Guardian
A stoic dwarf in full plate stands tall amongst a flaming
inferno as he stares down a red dragon many times his size,
he takes a steadying breath and raises his shield, preparing
himself for yet another onslaught of whirling claws and
gnashing teeth.

From the back of a rowdy tavern a smug looking human in
worn down chain mail hurls insults back an forth with a
group of grizzled miners, eventually finding himself battered,
bruised, and banned from yet another local tavern.

Swarmed by a writhing hoard of undead, an Elf in gleaming
white armor coats her blade with the ichor of one
approaching monstrosity after another, all while keeping the
frightened young tiefling wrapped around her ankle safe and
secure.

When the situation is at its most dire, there is no one better
to have at your side than a guardian. These stalwart warriors
use their inciting taunts and impregnable defenses to become
a living wall between their allies and certain doom. Whether
a guardian is a valiant knight, silver-tounged sellsword, or
stubborn general they all excel at guiding their comrades
through the most hopeless of circumstances and emerging on
the other side victorious.

### Defensive Combatants
At their core, guardians don't differ much from other physical
combatants in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Using
their martial prowess to overcome a foe is nothing new to a
guardian. However, unlike their martial cousins who prefer to
swing at an enemy until it falls or they do, guardians take a
more defensive approach to dealing with threats. Blocks or
parries take precedent over swings or thrusts and a sturdy
guard is a key tool in any guardians toolkit.

While all guardians share a defense that rivals greatest
knights of the realms, they all differ in their methods of
defending. Some guardians simply defend themselves with a
shield, some augment their defenses with magic, and some
use cunning words to defend themselves on the social
battlefield. However they choose to defend themselves, you
can be sure that cracking the defense of a guardian is no easy
feat.

### Force of Personality
Though they serve their purpose, a shield or weapon aren't
the only tools that a guardian carries into battle. Alongside
the equipment that can be seen upon their backs each
guardian carries themselves with a powerful demeanor that
both allies and enemies alike can feel with just a glance.

In combat, guardians use this palpable social aura along
with taunting words or threatening actions to draw the anger
and hostility out of their enemies. Though they might not
enjoy taking the beating that follows, a guardian will wear the
battle scars proudly, knowing that each one could have
instead been worn by a valued comrade.

### Creating a Guardian
As you create your guardian character, think about why, or if,
your character chooses to protect others? What led you to
hone your defenses to the point that they became your
weapon? Is there a certain group that trained you to protect
others, or perhaps a group that you were trained to protect? A
wise and caring mentor, the unique skills and weapons of
your homeland, or a former ward or occupation could all have
been factors.

You might have failed to protect a loved one and vowed to
never let it happen again. Perhaps you were saved by a
legendary guardian and aspire to become like them. You
could've been trained by the city watch to defend the public
from those that would endanger them. Maybe you simply
excelled at defending to the point that it became your style of
fighting. Whatever your reason for becoming a guardian, your
wit and your armor now stand as a towering shield defending
yourself and your allies.

#### Quick Build
You can make a guardian quickly by following these
suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score,
this will allow you to utilize your heavy armor effectively. Your
next-highest score should be Constitution or Charisma
depending on whether you would rather take hits well or
serve as a solid distraction. Second, choose the knight
background.

#### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**: To qualify for multiclassing with the Cavalier
class, you must meet these prerequisites: 13 Strength or
Dexterity and 13 Charisma
<br>
**Proficiencies**: When you multiclass into the
Guardian class, you gain the following
proficiencies: Light armor, medium armor,
shields, simple weapons, and
martial weapons.

### Inner Fire
You have a fire within you that allows you to press on through
blows that would bring others to their knees. When you take
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your
reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to your
Inner Fire die + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your
choice). Your Inner Fire die is a special die that changes as
you level up as shown on the guardian table.

If any items in your possession grant you a magical bonus
to your AC, you may choose one such item and add it's
magical AC bonus to the damage reduction of this feature.

### Combat Maneuvers
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Adamant Mountain, Sanguine Knot and Tempered Iron. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool.

\page

The Maneuvers Known column of the Guardian table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Daring Taunt
Starting at 2nd level, you use taunting words or simple
battlefield presence to draw the attention of your foes away
from your allies. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can
see within 60 of you that can see or hear you. The target
must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Daring
Taunt save DC as shown below. If you've damaged the target
since the end of your last turn or you are currently within 15
feet of the target, it has disadvantage on this saving throw. On
a failure, it suffers the following effects until the end of its
next turn:
- It has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other
than you
- When it uses a damaging spell or effect that doesn't
require it to make an attack roll, it must make a Wisdom
saving throw against your Daring Taunt save DC before
deciding on targets. On a failure, the effect must include
you as a target or include you in its area of effect
<div style="text-align:center;">
**Daring Taunt save DC** = 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your Charisma modifier
</div>

### Stand Behind Me
Also at 2nd level, you are able to act as living shield for your
allies. As an action, choose a creature within 5 feet of you to
shield from harm. Until the start of your next turn, it has
resistance to all damage types except psychic damage and
each time it takes non-psychic damage, you take the same
amount of damage. If the target of your protection is ever
more than 5 feet away from you, this effect ends immediately.

### Steely Mien
At 2nd level your combat experience becomes obvious on some subtle level, influencing how people perceive you, or perhaps how you see them. Choose one of the following options:

#### Closed Helm
You have great control over your emotions; your face is an unmoving mask, revealing nothing of what you’re thinking. Creatures have disadvantage on Insight checks made against you. In addition, you gain an expertise die on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

<div style="margin-top:40px;">
	
</div>

#### Heroic Flair
Your victories have emboldened you and you radiate with heroic confidence. You have advantage on Persuasion checks made to influence friendly creatures with a CR lower than your fighter level.

#### Watchful Eye
You are eternally alert and wary, ready for trouble. You have advantage on Insight checks made to determine hostile intent or predict violence, and your passive Perception increases by 5.

### Defensive Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype which determines the
kind of shield you will be for your allies from the list of
available archetypes. Your archetype choice grants you
features at 3rd level and then again at 6th, 13th, and 18th
level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

You can forgo taking this
feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Reserves
At 4th level your stamina increases, allowing you to engage foes longer without tiring. Your exertion pool increases by 1. At 8th, 12th, and 16th level your exertion pool increases by an additional point.

### Extra Reaction
Starting at 5th level, when you end your turn without using
your action to cast a spell or use a magic item, you can take
an additional reaction before the start of your next turn. You
can only use one reaction per triggering effect. When you
cast a non-cantrip spell as a reaction, you can't do so again
until the start of your next turn.

The number of additional reactions granted by this feature
increases to two when you reach 11th level in this class and
to three when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Guardian's Presence
Also at 5th level, your battlefield influence helps to keep your
enemies from ignoring you. When a creature within 10 feet of
you attempts to move away from you, you can use your
reaction to draw their attention. The creature must make a
Wisdom Saving throw against your Daring Taunt save DC.
On a success, it takes psychic damage equal to your Inner
Fire die and it cannot willingly move away from you until the
end of its turn. If damage from this feature would reduce a
creature to 0 hit points, they fall to 1 hit point instead.

\page

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses when you
finish a short or long rest.

<div class="descriptive">
##### Xpert Advice: Damage reduction
Damage reduction is applied to total damage before resistances are calculated
</div>

### Juggernaut
Starting at 6th level, you press through movement impairing
effects with ease. While you are conscious, your move speed
cannot be reduced without setting it to 0. Additionally, you are
immune to non-magical difficult terrain and difficult terrain
from spells cast at a level less than half of your guardian level.

### Martial Lore
At 6th level, your knowledge of martial lore deepens. Choose one of the following options:

#### Military Traditions
You’ve familiarized yourself with wars long past and military protocols of the present. You gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks made to recall lore or gather information regarding warfare or military action. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made to influence soldiers, guards, or other organized martial forces. 

#### Size Up
Your combat experience against a wide variety of foes has given you a good eye for evaluating threats. You can use a bonus action to determine the CR of a creature you can see within 200 feet, and that creature’s maneuver DC. 

#### Weapon Lore
You gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks made to recall lore or gather information about weapons, armor, and other martial equipment. In addition, you can use an action to investigate the magical properties of such an item by handling it, such as swinging a sword or hefting a shield. You learn its properties, how to use them, whether it requires attunement, and how many charges it has. You also learn if the item has any sentience or bears a curse, though you only learn if it is sentient or cursed (not the nature of that sentience or curse). 

### Potent Taunt
Starting at level 7, your taunts draw the attention of your
target so thoroughly that they momentarily forget about your
allies. When a creature fails its saving throw against your
Daring Taunt feature it suffers the following effect in addition
to the normal effects of your Daring Taunt feature:
- The next attack roll against it made by a creature other
than you has advantage

Additionally, when a creature succeeds on its saving throw
to resist your Daring Taunt feature by 5 or less, you can
choose to have it suffer one effect of your Daring Taunt
feature of your choice.

When you reach level 17 in this class, the success margin
of this feature increases from 5 to 10.

### Unbreakable
By 9th level, openings in your defense are few and far
between. When you suffer a critical hit, you can turn that hit
into a normal hit (no action required). Any effects triggered by
a critical hit are canceled.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until the
start of your next turn.

### Reputation
At 10th level, your reputation has begun to precede you. Choose one of the following options:

#### Inspiring
You’re a reputed leader, a person to be trusted whose words are to be heeded. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. In addition, you may spend 1 exertion point as a bonus action to inspire a creature that can hear you. The creature makes an Insight check opposed by your Persuasion check, becoming inspired by you on a failure. Indifferent creatures you inspire in this way become friendly towards you and your allies, and friendly creatures you inspire in this way will consider you an ally and may provide you with local information that would otherwise remain secret. Creatures will remain inspired by you indefinitely unless you do something that would make them hostile or lose confidence in you, such as lying, stealing, or causing them or their allies harm, or being proven cowardly or untrustworthy in any way. 

#### Intimidating
You’re reputed to be a terror to your foes and a fearsome ally. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. In addition, you can use a bonus action and spend 1 exertion point to intimidate one creature you can see. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a frightened creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Legendary
Your deeds have become epic stories, growing bigger and more outlandish with each retelling. You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion point to weave your real legendary deeds into a Persuasion check as boasting,
or include

\page

fabricated legendary deeds into a Deception check. When you do so, you have advantage on the check. 

### Tireless
Starting at 14th level, you are immune to all effects of
fatigue except death. Additionally, you lose 1 level of
fatigue when you complete a short rest and all levels of
fatigue when you complete a long rest.

### War's Toll
At 14th level, your experiences have left their impressions on you. All the lives ended—both friends and foes—inevitably weighs down on a person, and each must find their own way to cope and pay the toll of war. Choose one of the following.

#### Battle Scarred
You’ve embraced every victory and loss, and you wear each battle scar like a badge of honor. Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points you gain a new permanent scar or mark, and you gain inspiration. Once you gain inspiration in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest .

#### Carouser
You cope through drink and revelry, and have mastered both. You can gain the benefits of a long rest by spending 4 hours drinking, carousing, and taking the occasional blackout nap. You can carouse in this way so long as you consume at least 4 pint’s worth of ale (or equivalent drink), and you are alert and aware of your surroundings while doing so. If you carouse with another creature in this way, you can attempt to learn secrets from it by drinking it under the table. Each hour you spend carousing with a willing creature, make an opposed Constitution check. On a success, that creature answers a question truthfully (even questions it would not normally answer). 

In addition, you can enjoy alcohol as normal but can’t gain the poisoned condition from it.

This feature has no effect on creatures that are immune to the poisoned condition.  

#### One Eye Open
Your life has been so regularly in danger that you’ve learned to literally sleep with one eye open. You are alert and aware of your surroundings while sleeping during long rests . You can also never be surprised and you gain an expertise die on initiative checks.

### Unstoppable
Beginning at 15th level, your approach has become a near
inevitability for most foes. When you make an ability check or
saving throw to prevent or end the frightened, grappled,
prone, restrained, paralyzed, or stunned condition, you can
add your Inner Fire die to the result

### Pervasive Taunt
At 17th level, your taunts are so infectious that they often
anger more than one of your opponents. When you use your
Daring Taunt feature you can choose up to two valid targets,
instead of one.

### Unyielding Bastion
At 20th level, when you roll initiative you may choose to roll
your Inner Fire die three times and gain that many temporary
hit points. Then, if you have no uses of Guardian's Presence
remaining, you regain 1 use.

### Guarding Knacks

#### Amphibious Combatant
You gain a swimming speed equal to your Speed, and may spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check related to aquatic activity (such as Athletics checks to swim, Acrobatics checks to keep balance on a ship’s deck, or Constitution checks to hold your breath). You may choose whether to use the new roll or the original. In addition, you add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can hold your breath before suffocating, and can spend 1 exertion to hold your breath for an additional minutes equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Burst of Strength
You have moments of incredible strength. You may spend 1 exertion to add your proficiency bonus to a Strength check, even if you already add your proficiency bonus to the check. 

#### Campaigner
You have the ability to go for the long haul, carrying heavy equipment across long distances. You double your Strength score when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, push, or drag. You may also add your proficiency bonus to the number of hours you can march before you risk fatigue from a forced march.

#### Clearsight Sentinel
You gain darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. In addition, you do not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in lightly obscured areas (such as in light fog, moderate foliage, or heavy precipitation).

#### Extreme Leap
When you take the Dash action and make a long jump after moving no less than 20 feet, your jump distance is doubled for the turn. You may spend 1 exertion to triple your jump distance for the turn instead, and may move the full distance of your jump even if it exceeds your Speed.

\page

#### Mountaineer
You gain a climbing speed equal to your Speed, and may spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed Athletics check to climb, choosing whether to use the new roll or the original. In addition, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

#### Nightwatch
You are used to sleeping light and making the most of your rest. When taking a long rest, add your proficiency bonus to the number of hours you can spend in light activity. In addition, one hour of that time can be spent in strenuous activity near the rest site (such as patrolling, fighting, or other adventuring activities) without interrupting your rest.

#### Stable Footing
A steady stance and careful footwork is instinctive to you. You have advantage on any check or saving throw to avoid falling prone or handle difficult ground (such as against a grease spell or slippery ice). You are never prone after taking fall damage, and when calculating fall damage you treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number of feet equal to your proficiency bonus × 10.

#### Weather Beaten
Exposed to all kinds of weather over your life, you are inured to all but the most deadly effects. You gain advantage on saving throws against cold and hot weather, as well as any adverse effects from wind or precipitation.

## Defensive Archetypes
When it comes to defending themselves and their allies, all
guardians are experts. However, each individual guardian
may differ in who, how, and why they offer this protection.
Your archetype represents the skills and techniques you use
to keep those under your protection safe.

}}


## Mystic Herald
Mystic Heralds augment their defenses with magics
borrowed from the teachings of bards, using arcane magic
channeled through rousing words or music to defend
themselves and their allies.

### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your defenses with
the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules
of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.

**Cantrips**. You learn three cantrips: guidance and two of
your choice from the bard spell list. You learn an additional
bard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots**. The Mystic Herald Spellcasting table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend
a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you
know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-
level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.

**Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher**. You know three
1st-level bard spells of your choice from the abjuration and
enchantment spells on the bard spell list, one of these spells
can come from any class's spell list instead.
The Spells Known column of the Mystic Herald
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more bard spells of
1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration
or enchantment spell of your choice, and must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach
7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or
2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come
from any class's spell list.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one
of the bard spells you know with another spell of your choice
from the bard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for
which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or
enchantment spell. When replacing the spell you gained at
3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level it can come from any class's spell
list instead.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Charisma is your spellcasting ability
for your bard spells, since your magic comes from the heart
and soul you pour into protecting your allies. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align:center;">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Charisma modifier
	
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your
Charisma modifier
</div>

}}

### Vocalization
At 3rd level, the range of your guidance cantrip, your ranged
spells, and your Daring Taunt feature increase by 30 feet.

### Emboldening Magic
Starting at 6th level, the spectacle of your magic emboldens
your allies. When you cast a non-cantrip spell, you can choose
a creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you to gain
temporary hit points equal to your Inner Fire die. 

### Aggravating Tune
By 13th level, your taunts distract the mind of your target so
thoroughly that they lose focus on avoiding your spells.
Creatures under at least one effect of your Daring Taunt
feature have disadvantage on saving throws against any spells
you cast.

\page

### Deflective Ward
At 18th level, you are able to channel your arcane magic into
a defensive wall that protects you and your allies from harm.
As an action or bonus action, you raise your arcane defenses
and a translucent wall of arcane magic springs into existence
in front of you. Choose and place a 25 foot long, 10 foot tall
panel such that the center of the panel intersects an edge of
your space.

At the start of each of your turns you can reposition the wall into any position that follows the original
placement rules. You can dismiss the wall at any time (no
action required).

The wall functions as a physical wall with a maximum
number of hit points equal to double your guardian level. The
wall has an AC equal to your Daring Taunt save DC and
automatically fails saving throws to resist spells and other
damaging effects. The wall is considered total cover against
spells and weapons attacks. The wall is immune to psychic
damage. As an action, you can roll your Inner Fire die twice
and have the wall regain that many hit points. When it is
reduced to zero hit points you take any remaining damage
and the wall remains, but it is intangible until it regains hit
points.

## Oathsworn
Guardians that live by the oathsworn defensive archetype
have or make a sworn oath to protect a specific person with
their life. An oathsworn guardian might swear an oath out of
love, loyalty, debt or some other reason of grand importance.
Whatever their reason, oathsworn guardians all share the
common goal of protecting their chosen companion, no
matter the consequences.

### Oathsworn Bond
At 3rd level, you dedicate yourself to protecting a member of
your party with stoic intensity. When you select this subclass,
you swear an oath to protect a willing friendly creature who
then becomes your Bonded Companion. You remain bonded
this way until your Bonded Companion dies or frees you from
your oath. If your bond should end, you must wait at least 24
hours before swearing another oath. When you complete a
long rest after that time period, you may swear a new oath.

You are quick to answer the call when your companion
needs help. When your Bonded Companion is targeted by an
attack, spell, or other effect that you can see, you can use your
reaction to move up to half of your movement towards them.
If you are adjacent to them after this movement, you may
swap places with them and become the new target of the
triggering effect. You suffer a -5 penalty to your AC and
disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the
triggering effect as you open yourself up to incoming threats.

### Helpful Hand
Also at 3rd level, when you take the Help action to assist your
Bonded Companion with a skill check that they are proficient
in or vice versa, the target of the Help action may add your
Charisma modifier to the result.

<div style="margin-top:40px"></div>

### Bolstering Resolve
Starting at 6th level, your strong will to protect your
companion inspires them to press on. If your Bonded
Companion is within 30 feet of you when you use your Inner
Fire feature, they can use their reaction to gain temporary hit
points equal to the amount of damage reduced.

### Comforting Bond
At 13th level, being near each other sets both you and your
companion's minds at ease. While you are within 30 feet of
each other and both of you are conscious, you and your
bonded companion can add your Inner Fire die to
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

### Unspoken Word
By 13th level, you are so close with your companion that you
both can understand what each other are thinking without
the need of words. While you can see each other, you and
your Bonded Companion can communicate simple ideas
through facial expressions and behaviors that are
imperceptible to others. You must be bonded with your
current companion for at least 7 days to use this feature.

### No Matter the Cost
At 18th level, you will defend your companion until the very
end. When your bonded companion takes damage of any type
except psychic, you can choose to take the damage for them if
they are within 5 feet of you (no action required). This
damage can't be reduced in any way.

If using this feature reduces you to 0 hit points, your
companion is inspired by your sacrifice. They can choose to
gain temporary hit points equal to your guardian level and
may add your Inner Fire die to attack rolls, damage rolls, and
saving throws until the end of their next turn.

Once you use this feature to inspire your companion, you
cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.


## Renegade
Renegades are oddities among guardians. These foul-
mouthed mercenaries who rarely concern themselves with
the well-being of their party hardly fit the definition of
guardian.

\page

However, through a mix of ludicrous taunts and
martial competence, they tend to draw the attention of their
foes regardless.

### Fighting Style
At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take
the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
get to choose again.


#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
Dueling Interrogation Tactics

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no
other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that
weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two
hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even
if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.


#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you,
within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction
to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your
proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be
wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this
reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you
that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding
a shield to use this reaction.

#### Shielding
When a creature within 5 feet of you makes a Dexterity
saving throw against an effect that you can see, such as a trap
or spell, you can use your reaction to give them advantage on
the roll. You must be wielding a shield to use this reaction.

#### Reactive Fighting
Your opportunity attacks gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

#### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to
1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding
any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the
d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4
bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

### Interrogation Tactics
Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Charisma
(Intimidation) skill if you don't already have it. Additionally,
you can use blackmail, provoking statements, and insults to
draw information out of a target. As a bonus action, you ask a
creature that can hear you a yes or no question and make a
Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by a Wisdom saving
throw from the target. If you succeed, the target must
truthfully answer yes, no, or I don't know.
Once you use this feature on a creature, they are immune
to it for the next 24 hours.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Is That All Ya Got?
Starting at 13th level, when you take damage from a creature
within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to insult the
creature. The creature must make Wisdom saving throw
against your Daring Taunt save DC or become blindly
enraged by your insult. On a failure, the creature must
immediately use its reaction to recklessly charge 15 feet
directly towards you and you have advantage on your next
attack roll against it before the end of your next turn.

### Outrageous Affront
At 18th level, you've mastered the art of pissing off your
enemies. When you use your Daring Taunt feature, you can
choose to make it an Outrageous Affront. Creatures always
have disadvantage on their saving throw to resist your
Outrageous Affront. On a failure, it suffers the following
effects in addition to the normal effects of your Daring Taunt:
- Any attacks it makes must target you
- Any time it uses a damaging spell or effect that doesn't
require an attack roll, it must include you as a target or
include you in its area of effect
- It must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves
when moving away from you

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
Charisma modifier and you regain all expended when you
finish a Long Rest


## Warden
Guardians that embody the Warden defensive archetype have
honed their defenses to a ridiculous degree. These guardians
train day in and day out to ensure that nothing stands a
chance of bypassing their guard.

\page

### Improved Guard
When you choose this subclass at 3rd level, your defense has
become so potent that even the arcane arts struggle to find a
weak point. Fire, Cold, Lightning, Thunder, and Acid are
added to the list of damage types that you can use your Inner
Fire reaction against.

Additionally, the first time between each of your turns that
you use your Inner Fire reaction you can add your guardian
level to the damage reduction.
### Ever Vigilant
At 6th level, you are always on the lookout for threats against
the lives of yourself and your companions. You gain the
following benefits:
- You cannot be surprised while you are conscious
- You can add your Charisma modifier to initiative rolls

### Superior Guard
Starting at 13th level, your mental and physical defenses are
legendary. You can use your Inner Fire reaction whenever you
take damage, regardless of the type.

### Impenetrable Guard
Also at 13th level, your defenses remain strong even when
you aren't actively guarding yourself. When you take damage
and don't use your Inner Fire reaction, you can reduce the
damage by an amount equal to your Strength or Dexterity
modifier (your choice).

### Relentless Defender
At 18th level, you are relentless in your pursuit of defending
your allies. If you are able to see or hear at least one living
ally when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed
outright, roll 1d20. On a result of 6 or greater, you can choose
to drop to 1 hit point instead.

\page
# Keeper
Standing not quite alone among the remains of an ancient
battlefield, a human bargains with the shade of an old soldier,
offering to share some of the privileges of mortal life in return
for spiritual power and protection. A bargain is made, and the
soldier vanishes, joining the human's collection of spirits.

Hand grasped tight to the leash locked to the neck of their
hellhound, a tiefling brandishes a knife in their other hand as
their companion spits sparks and cinders from the gaps in its
jagged teeth. The tiefling barks an order, and the leash drops;
the hound howls, loud and angry, and it bolts forward after its
master's enemy with hate in its eyes and fire in its belly.

Islands of calm in an ocean of chaos, a genasi fights side-
by-side with their companion, a crackling stormcloud trapped
in humanoid shape by burnt rags and bandages. As one, both
keeper and companion fall into other, merging into a singular
being, veins pulsing with blue light, and the battle continues.

Keepers and their companions form a gate between mortal
life and the spirit world, defined by their bond with each other
and the covenant they form. Through esoteric magic, keepers
command tiny, unseen spirits, as well as bonds that permeate
the multiverse. Drawing on that power, keepers bind the wills
of others, discover secrets, summon otherworldly beings, and
make their voices heard.

### Modest Magic
Seven gods live in every grain of rice. A thousand more live in
every meal, and a thousand, thousand more than that in every
home. This is the keeper's wisdom. Where other spellcasters
call magic from a higher power or from within, keepers learn
the names of lesser spirits in their surroundings, form bonds
with them, and draw on them for strength.

In this way, keepers captivate the world's attention in their
travels, but must be careful to avoid its wrath. Spirits respond
well to bold declarations of power and intent, but turn quickly
on liars and oathbreakers. Keepers must be careful to keep to
their word—at least while the universe is listening.

### Open the Gate
All things must come to dust, and spirits are no exception. If
they aren't killed, consumed, or even simply starved of energy,
a spirit can still fade if it's forgotten. Some of these spirits can
even slip from the world entirely, falling through the cracks in
creation if they lose their connections to the people, places or
objects that anchor them to the mortal world.

To stave off their ending, a spirit might form a covenant
with a mortal, tying the two together and granting the spirit a
reprieve from having to nourish its dwindling flame. Through
this bond, the mortal is immersed in the occult and unearthly,
and taught the secrets of spirits, while the spirit is immersed
in mortal life so that it might enjoy freedoms and pleasures it
otherwise couldn't claim, and flee the jaws of oblivion.

Like any relationship, a keeper and companion must work
to maintain the health of their bond throughout their years. If
either comes to resent the other, their bond can become toxic
and harmful to both parties. Traditionally, the keeper decides
the rules, and tightens their companion's bonds if they refuse
— but not all relationships are traditional, and the greatest of
keepers and companions rely on mutual trust and respect.

### Creating a Keeper
As you create your keeper, you should ask yourself two
questions above all others; who is your companion, and what
are they to you? Did you find and protect a newborn spirit, or
come to look after a strange being that hatched from a stone?
Were you in danger, and saved by striking a deal with a spirit,
or did you hunt and capture one, forcing it to serve you?

Your companion's nature has a great effect on your bond.
Are they a celestial who came to you in a moment of need, in
return for you spreading their influence? Did you trick a fiend
into your service, wielding its true name like a leash? Did you
earn the attention of a fey, trading its service for some strange
sacrifice you would later regret? Perhaps you even made your
companion, raising them from a dead living being or granting
them a home within a body of your own construction.

Consider also your spellcasting. Your power comes from
your bond with your companion and other spirits, but what of
your magical knowledge? Did you companion tutor you in the
workings of your newfound power, or were you taught by your
family in accordance with age old tradition? You may not even
understand the rules, simply figuring them out as you plunge
deeper and deeper into the realm of the occult.

#### Strange Company
However ordinary a keeper's companion may seem, they are
fundamentally a different type of being.

Many have quirks and
habits alien to mortals, and fail to grasp what might seem like
simple concepts, such as the passage of time.
Have your companion's quirks ever gotten you in a bind?
Are they harmless, even funny, or more sinister than that? Do
they try to adapt to common convention, or have you adapted
to them? At your option, you can roll on the Strangeness table
to inform your companion's habits.

\page

##### Strangeness
| D6  | Strangeness |
|:---:|:-----:|
| 1		| Your companion has known your family for ages, and can't tell you apart from your ancestors|
| 2   | "How often do mortals need to eat again? Once a month? It can't be once a week, can it?"     |
| 3   | Your companion wears in a new outfit each time it's summoned. You don't know where they come from—or where they go afterwards.     |
| 4   | Your companion can't lie. At all. Ever.     |
| 5   | No matter what you try, your companion can't tell the difference between people and animals.     |
| 6   | Your companion repeats the same conversations over and over like they haven't happened before.     |

#### Relationship
Each keeper has a different relationship with their bound
companion. Some are like an owner and a pet, and some are
more equal, but all are unique. Equally, a keeper's bond with
their companion can change as time advances. A companion
that was once rebellious might become more peaceful, while
a cruel, domineering keeper might learn to treat their partner
with more trust and kindness than before.

Do you resent the relationship you and your companion
have, or cherish it? Do you take it for granted? Was it always
this way, or has it shifted? At your option, you can roll on the
Relationship table to inform the relationship you have.

##### Relationship
| D6 | Relationship |
|:--:|:------------:|
|1   |You and your companion love and trust each other more than anyone else in the world.|
|2   |Your companion is a tool. Not good, not bad, just a tool. It'd be silly to treat it as more than that.|
|3   |For so long as you and your companion obey the terms you agreed on, you're both content.|
|4   |Your companion is a monster. You've transformed it into a weapon against its kind.|
|5   |Secretly, you're afraid of your companion. It obeys your commands, but for how long?|
|6   |Your companion holds the power, not you, and it forces you to follow certain demands.|

<div class="descriptive">

##### New Spells
	
The Keeper introduces several new spell options.
Spells marked with KS can be found at the end of
the document.
##### Your Companion
A keeper's companion is an intelligent creature,
potentially able to speak and give its opinion. Some
players might find the addition of another creature
distracting. As you create your companion, discuss
several things with your DM and fellow players:

- Will your companion speak in social scenes? If
so, who will play them?
- How independent is your companion?
- Will possible conversation or conflict with your
companion detract from anyone's enjoyment?

You might decide that your companion can't
speak and always follows your commands, or even
the exact opposite. More important than anything
is that everyone playing is enjoying themselves, so
be sure to be clear and open.
</div>

#### Quick Build
You can make a keeper quickly following these suggestions.
First, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by
Constitution unless you plan to seal the Covenant of Strife—
in which case, make Strength or Dexterity your next-highest
ability score. Second, choose the hermit or sage background.
Third, choose the elemental blessing, guidance, and frostbite
cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells cure wounds, detect
evil and good, and Tasha's hideous laughter.


#### Multiclassing
Multiclassing as a keeper uses the following rules.

**Prerequisites**. The prerequisite for multiclassing as a
keeper is a Charisma score of 13 or higher.

**Proficiencies**. When you multiclass into keeper, you gain
proficiency in light armour and with simple weapons. When
determining your total spell slots, you add half your keeper
level to your total using the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

\page

### Bound Companion
You have performed an occult ritual with a spirit, binding the
pair of you together. Using your action, you can summon your
bound companion in an unoccupied space you can see within
30 feet of you, or cause it to vanish again. It is friendly to you
and your companions, obeys your commands, and it uses the
Bound Companion stat block, modified in the following ways:
- It uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
- You choose your companion's creature type, which can be
any type except humanoid.
- You choose if your companion is Small, Medium, or Large.
- You choose your companion's damage type, which can be
any type. This choice determines the damage of its Strike,
and affects other Keeper features you gain.

You also determine your companion's appearance and its
personality, and whether or not your companion can speak;
your choice has no effect on its game statistics. In addition,
choose an aspect from the list of Companion Aspects.

In combat, your companion acts during your turn. It can
move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it
takes is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action on
your turn to command it to take another action. That action
can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are
incapacitated, it can take any action of its choice.

When your companion dies, it vanishes, and you can't
summon it until you finish a short or long rest, at which point
it reappears at your side with all its hit points. By spending 1
minute performing a healing ritual and expending a spell slot
of 1st level or higher, you can touch your companion, causing
it to regain all lost hit points. Your companion also regains all
lost hit points during a short rest.

## Companion Aspects
Your companion's aspect determines its general shape, traits,
and strengths. Each aspect represents many different forms—
for example, the Hurling aspect could represent an archer, an
acid-spitting ooze, or even a stone-hurling golem.

#### Hunting
This aspect can represent anything fast and powerful, such as
a dire wolf, elk, minotaur, sabre-toothed tiger, or hell hound.

**Charge**. If your companion moves at least 20 feet straight
toward a creature and then hits it with its Strike on the same
turn, the creature must make a Strength saving throw against
your keeper spell save DC. If it fails, the target falls prone and
takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Quick**. Your companion's base walking speed is 50 feet.

The damage of this attack increases by 1d6 when
you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level.
}}

#### Hurling
This aspect can represent anything magically charged or well
armed, such as an elemental, manticore, or barbed devil.

**Hardy**. If your companion's damage type isn't bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing, it has immunity to that damage type. If
it is, your companion has advantage on saving throws against
being knocked prone and against forced movement.

**Ranged**. Your companion can make ranged attacks. These
attacks are ranged weapon attacks (range 90 ft.) that use the
same attack and damage rolls as its Strike attack.

#### Skulking
This aspect can represent anything dark and opportunistic,
such as a shade, phantom, will o' the wisp, or cat-s ì th

**Escape**. Your companion doesn't provoke oppoortunity
attacks when it moves out of an enemy's reach.

**Umbral**. Your companion can move through spaces as
narrow as 1-inch wide without squeezing, and has darkvision
out to a range of 60 feet. Your companion can't discern colour
in darkness, only shades of grey.

\page

#### Soaring
This aspect can represent anything airborne and watchful,
such as a griffon, drake, gargoyle, demon or devil, or valkyrie.

**Keen Eyed**. Your companion has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Winged**. Your companion gains a flying speed of 40 feet. It
can't fly while it's mounted or while grappling a creature until
you reach 5th level in this class.

#### Stinging
This aspect can represent anything toxic and clinging, such
as a snake, venomous lizard, spider, or spore monster.

**Toxic Strike**. Once per turn, when your companion hits a
creature with its Strike, it can force the target to succeed on a
Constitution saving throw against your keeper spell save DC
or take poison damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Wallcrawler**. Your companion can climb difficult surfaces,
including across ceilings, without making an ability check. It
also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

#### Swimming
This aspect can represent anything aquatic and ensnaring,
such as an octopus, toad, kelpie, or grindylow.

**Amphibious**. Your companion can breathe air and water,
and has a swimming speed of 40 feet.
**Grasping**. Once per turn, when your companion hits a
creature with its Strike, it can force the target to succeed on
a Strength saving throw. If it fails, your companion grapples it
(escape DC for the grapple equals your keeper spell save DC).
While it lasts, your companion has advantage on attack rolls
against the target, and can't attack other targets.

#### Warding
This aspect can represent anything sturdy or tenacious, such
as a tortoise, bear, or zombie, or a suit of animated armour.

**Defend**. When a creature within 5 feet of your companion
is hit by an attack and your companion can see the attacker, it
can defend the target using its reaction. The target takes half
the attack's damage, and your companion takes the rest.

**Tough**. Your companion's hit point maximum is 2 higher,
increasing by 2 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

### Spellcasting
You've earned the attention of the world around you, and
established yourself as a force of change. See Chapter 10 of
the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting
and the end of this document for the Keeper spell list.

#### Spell Slots
The Keeper table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your keeper spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or
higher. You regain all of your expended keeper spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell healing word
and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you
can cast healing word using either slot.

#### Spells Known
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the
keeper spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Keeper table shows when
you learn more keeper spells of your choice. Each of these
spells must be of a level for which you have keeper spell slots.
For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the keeper spells you know and replace it with
another spell from the keeper spell list, which also must be of
a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your keeper spells,
since their power comes from commanding the world around
you. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a keeper spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align:center;">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier

</div>

<div class="descriptive">

##### Mix and Match
The aspects above represent many forms that your
companion could take, but not all of them. If you're
having trouble creating your ideal companion using
the options available, your DM might let you create
a new aspect by choosing two traits from different
aspects and assigning them to your companion.
	
For example, you could combine the Stinging
aspect's Toxic Strike with the Swimming aspect's
Amphibious to represent a deadly jellyfish.

A new aspect should be no more powerful than
the aspects described above. The DM has final say
on which traits you can combine (if any). Exercise
caution—combining some traits, such as Ranged
and Winged or a pair of two traits that affect your
companion's attacks can unbalance the game.	
</div>

\page

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a keeper spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Combat Maneuvers
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in your choice of two traditions from: Beast Unity, Cutting Omen, Sanguine Knot or Mirror's Glint. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You use your maneuvers by spending exertion points, but you do not gain an exertion pool. Instead, at the start of each of your turns you can expend spell slots of 1st-level or higher to gain exertion points that go into a temporary exertion pool which lasts until you start your next long rest . You gain 2 exertion points for a 1st-level spell slot, and 2 more for each spell slot level above 1st. Only spell slots gained from the herald class can be expended in this way.

The Maneuvers Known column of the Keeper table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Well of Power
Starting at 2nd level, you can spend 1 minute drawing power
from your companion to recover expended spell slots, which
must have a combined level that is equal to or less than than
half your keeper level (rounded up). None of the slots can be
6th level or higher. To use this feature, your companion must
be summoned, and you must be able to touch it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a long rest.

### Spirit Covenant
At 3rd level, you establish the bond between you and your
companion, and the gate you form between the mortal world
and the spiritual world. Choose the Covenant of Chains, the
Covenant of Strife, or the Covenant of Unity.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again 6th,
10th, and 15th level. Those features include covenant spells.

#### Covenant Spells
Each covenant has a list of spells—its covenant spells—you
gain at the keeper levels noted in the covenant description.
These spells count as keeper spells for you, but don't count
against your number of keeper spells known.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20
using this feature.

Or you can forgo taking this feature and instead pick a feat.

### Living Bond
Starting at 5th level, the damage of your companion's Strike
increases, as shown in the Bound Companion stat block. The
damage increases again at 11th level and at 17th level.

Additionally, your companion's attacks count as magical
for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Spirit Gate
Starting at 7th level, you can use a bonus action while
your companion is within 120 feet of you to teleport it to
the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, or to
teleport to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of
it. Alternatively, you both teleport, swapping places.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to
your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.

### Companion's Bond
At 9th level, your companion gains one of the following features:

**Camouflage**. The beast can take the Hide action as a bonus action. 

**Celerity**. The beast can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

**Evasion**. The beast can take the Dodge action as a bonus action.

### Battlesworn
Beginning at 11th level, when your companion's Strike
misses, you can reroll the attack if you can see the target.
You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### Loyalty's Reward
At 13th level, if damage reduces your companion to 0 hit points, it makes a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + the attack modifier of the damaging attack. On a success, your companion drops to 1 hit point instead.

Your companion can use this feature once between long rests .

\page

### Witch Gate
By 14th level, your companion is a gate to a world of magic,
and you are the key. You gain one 5th-level keeper spell slot,
in addition to the spell slots on the Keeper table.

At higher levels, you gain additional keeper spell slots: one
6th level spell slot at 17th level, and one 7th level spell slot at
20th level. You regain all of your expended keeper spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

### Lifebound
Beginning at 18th level, you and your companion are forever
linked, and you can draw on that bond to heal either yourself
or your companion, staving off even fatal injuries.

Once you this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a long rest.

**Companion**. When your companion is reduced to 0 hit
points, you can cause it to regain a number of hit points equal
to half its hit point maximum if you can see it. Alternatively, if
your companion is dead, you can use your action to return it
to life with half its hit points. If you do, you can summon it in
an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.

**Keeper**. When you're reduced to 0 hit points while your
companion can see you, you can instead regain a number of
hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Alternatively,
if you have 0 hit points, your companion can use its action to
touch you, causing you to regain a number of hit points equal
to half your hit point maximum. When it does, you can stand
up if you were prone

### World Gate
At 20th level, you are a key to the world of the living, and your
companion is the gate. If your companion finishes a long rest
and you're dead, you reform at its side with all your hit points,
and your original body fades away, leaving your equipment on
the ground. You can reform as a younger version of yourself, if
you wish.

### Cooperative Lessons

#### Beast Speech
You are under the constant effects of the speak with animals spell. This effect does not emit a magical aura.

#### Companion Token
Your companion gifts you with a companion token . You are unable to sell your companion token, and if you somehow lose it the next time you finish a long rest you discover it on your person. Once your token is consumed, your Companion replaces it and you find it on your person the next time you finish a long rest. For all intents and purposes, a companion token functions as a Patron Token

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

#### Lingering Touch
When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair, bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. If you are carrying the shed piece and attuned to it when you see the creature from which it originated, you immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at which point the attunement ends. At the Narrator’s discretion, you may learn additional cryptic information from being attuned to such things.

#### Ominous Insight
When you know, you know, you know? When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can attempt to draw on your companion's magics to find an answer and reroll the check. On a failure, your attempt clouds your mind and you have disadvantage on Intelligence checks until you finish a short rest . While suffering this disadvantage, you can’t use Ominous Insight again.

#### Quick Scan
You gain an expertise die on Investigation checks. You can use a bonus action to take the Search action.

#### Visions of Distant Realms
Prerequisite: 7th level

You can cast arcane eye once without spending spell slots. You cannot do so again until you finish a long rest, and you can only do it while your Companion is not summoned. 

At 15th level, you can instead cast arcane eye at will.

#### Voice of the Twin
So long as you are on the same plane of existence, you can communicate telepathically with your companion, perceive through your familiar’s senses, and also speak through your companion in your own voice (even if your companion is normally incapable of speech).

Conversely, you can also allow your companion to speak through you in its own voice, if it is capable of speech.

#### Whiff of the Beyond
You automatically know when an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature has been in a space within 30 feet of you within the past 24 hours, though not which type of creature triggered this invocation. 

Additionally, you gain an expertise die on Perception checks, and you have advantage on checks made to track these creatures.

\page
## Spirit Covenants
Each covenant defines the relationship between keeper and
companion. Two of the covenants below are among the most
ancient covenants sealed by keepers since time immemorial,
while the third—the covenant of Unity—is a newer creation, a
part of an attempt to foster better understanding with spirits.

Keepers are rarely united by sharing the same covenant
with another keeper. Though sealing such a deep bond with
their companion can make a keeper more empathetic, it can
just as easily make them suspicious of those they lack such a
tie with. When keepers of different covenants meet, however,
mutual curiosity and bargaining can delay any competition.

{{classTable,decoration,frame
##### Spirit Covenants
| Covenant 				  | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------:|
| Covenant of Chains  |Specialize in Summoning|
| Covenant of Strife    |Specialize in Combat|
| Covenant of Unity     |Specialize in Fusion|
}}

## Covenant of Chains
The Covenant of Chains marks the keeper as master, and a
companion one of many servants or partners. Keepers of the
chain are bound to more than one spirit, and can call on each
one of them to suit their changing needs.

Though the symbol of the chain implies subservience, a
keeper who swears this covenant isn't necessarily controlling
or cruel. A chain keeper's companions and summoned beings
could be anything from a group of employees to your family.

### Covenant of Chains Spells
You gain the covenant spells at the Keeper level listed
| Keeper Level | Spell |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 3rd   | command, find familiar|
| 5th   | hold person, summon beast|
| 9th   | spirit guardians, tiny servant|
| 13th  | dominate beast, summon elemental|
| 14th  | dominate person, planar binding|

### Circle of Spirits
When you seal this covenant at 3rd level, you bind yourself
to a second spirit using your Bound Companion feature. You
choose its statistics and its aspect the same way as your first
companion, as well as the spirit's personality, its appearance,
and whether or not the spirit can speak.

You can only have one companion at a time. You can
change which of your spirits serves as your companion when
you finish a long rest. You can also change which spirit serves
as your companion by spending 1 minute performing a ritual
—you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you
expend a spell slot for each ritual after the first.

When you change the spirit serving as your companion,
you summon the new companion in an unoccupied space you
can see within 30 feet of you with all its hit points. Thereafter,
that spirit appears whenever you summon your companion.

You bind yourself to another spirit when you reach 6th level
in this class, and again at 10th level and 15th level. When you
do, the choices you make should reflect the spirits you've met
and places you've visited on your adventures.

### Spirit Infusion
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that targets your
companion using your action, you can infuse it with spiritual
power. The next time that your companion hits with its Strike
before the end of the turn, it deals extra damage to the target.
The damage is 1d4 for a cantrip, plus 1d4 per spell level for a
spell of 1st level or higher.

### Ever Faithful
Starting when you reach 10th level, you can use your action
to change which spirit is serving as your companion.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you
finish a long rest.

### Hands of the Witch
Beginning at 15th level, you can have two companions at the
same time, and you can command both with the same bonus
action. When you change which of your spirits are serving as
your companions, you can change either or both.

If a keeper feature you use targets your companion, you
choose which it affects. For example, you can use your Spirit
Gate to teleport to either of your companions.

## Covenant of Strife
The Strife Covenant is a bond of conflict, and forever marks
a companion as either fierce ally or living weapon. No keeper
is more at home in war than a strife keeper, and keepers and
companions bound this way fight with incredible tenacity and
matchless harmony. Few die old, and fewer die peacefully.

Keepers of strife rarely seal this covenant without a good
reason, often holding a mission or grudge close to their heart.
If the keeper (or companion) reaches their goal, however, they
may find themselves lost—if your covenant is a weapon, what
do you do with it when the fighting's done?

\page

### Covenant of Strife Spells
You gain covenant spells at the keeper levels listed.

| Keeper Level | Spell |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 3rd   | cause fear, shield|
| 5th   | blade step, enhance ability|
| 9th   | enemies abound, haste|
| 13th  | confusion, shadow of moil|
| 14th  | antilife shell, steel wind strike|

### Lessons in Strife
When you seal this covenant at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with martial weapons, medium armour, and shields.

Additionally, you're always ready for conflict. You and your
companion can't sleep or be forced to sleep and don't need to.
You can still be knocked unconscious. To gain the benefits of
a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such
as pacing and keeping watch.

### Flow of Battle
Also at 3rd level, you learn special exploits you can use with
your companion. You learn three of the following exploits of
your choice. Once you use one of your exploits, you can't use
an exploit again until the start of your next turn.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one
exploit you know with another. You also learn one additional
exploit of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 15th level.

**Corner**. When you attack a creature your companion
attacked this turn, you can corner it. Until your next turn, the
creature has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against
you or your companion while within either of your reach.

**Distract**. When your companion hits a creature with its
Strike, you can move up to half your speed without provoking
opportunity attacks from the target using your reaction.

**Focus**. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can
knock it off balance. The next attack roll that your companion
makes against the target this turn has advantage.

**Guard**. When a creature targets you with an attack while
you're mounted on your companion, you can force that attack
to target your companion instead (no action required).

**Push**. When your companion hits a creature using its
Strike, it can push the target up to 10 feet away from it if you
attacked that creature this turn.

**Rush**. After you make an attack against a creature, hit or
miss, you can call for blood. Your companion can move up to
its speed towards the target as a reaction if it can see it.

**Trip**. When your companion hits a creature with its Strike,
it can force the target to make a Strength saving throw if you
hit the target with an attack this turn (DC equals your keeper
spell save DC). On a failed save, the target falls prone.

**Stagger**. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can
stagger it. Until your next turn, the target can't take reactions.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Spirit Frenzy
Starting at 10th level, if your turn ends in combat and you or
your companion attacked a hostile creature that turn, both of
you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + half your keeper
level. These temporary hit points last until your next turn.

### Strife's Shadow
Beginning at 15th level, you can make any spell you cast that
targets only you also target your companion.

## Covenant of Unity
Each keeper shares a powerful bond with their companion,
but the Covenant of Unity marks both as one half of a whole.
This intimate relationship blurs the line between keeper and
companion, giving both special insight into the other's world.

So great is the bond between keepers of unity and their
companions that the two can become a single, merged being.
These merged beings embody the relationship between each
partner, their mind and body shaped by that connection, and
are just as resilient as the kinship between their halves.

### Covenant Spells
You gain covenant spells at the keeper levels listed.

| Keeper Level | Spell |
|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 3rd   | absorb elements, cure wounds|
| 5th   | calm emotions, prayer of healing|
| 9th   | life transference, vampiric touch|
| 13th  | aura of life, charm monster|
| 14th  | circle of power, enervation|

### Unity
Starting when you choose this covenant at 3rd level, you
can use your action to touch your companion and unify with
it, merging into a single creature. Your companion vanishes,
and you can't summon it again while unified this way.
While unified, you gain the following benefits:

- You add your companion's hit point maximum and current
hit points to your own.
\page
- Your AC equals 13 + your proficiency bonus if the armour
you wear would leave you with a lower AC.
- You can use your companion's Strike as an attack option
with the Attack action. You can make one attack with it as
a bonus action, even if you don't use your action to attack.
- You gain the benefit of any of your companion's traits, and
you can use them as if you were your companion. You can
use your companion's senses, speeds, and proficiencies in
addition to your own. If it has a flying speed, you can't use
it until you reach 5th level in this class.

You can stay in this form for a number of hours equal to
half your keeper level. You and your companion then revert to
seperate forms unless you expend another use of this feature.
You can revert early using your action. You also revert early if
you fall unconscious, you drop to 0 hit points, or you die.

When you revert, your companion appears in the nearest
unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you divide any of
your remaining hit points as evenly as possible between you
and your companion. If you revert with 0 hit points, you and
your companion both fall unconscious and begin dying.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

### Stronger Together
Beginning at 6th level, when you or your companion take
damage while you're unified or within 10 feet of each other,
you can use your reaction and draw on the strength of your
bond to create one of the following effects:
- You halve the damage dealt to you or your companion.
- If the damage was dealt by an attacker that you can see,
you can deal 2d6 damage of your companion's type to it.
If you're unified, you can add your Charisma modifier to
the damage dealt.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest

### Kindred Spirit
Starting at 10th level, when you roll for initiative, you and
your companion can move up to your speed directly towards
each other if you aren't surprised and you can see each other
(no action required). If you end the move within 5 feet of your
companion, you can immediately use your Unity feature.

When you unify with your companion, or as an action while
unified, you can expend one spell slot to regain 2d8 hit points
per level of the spell slot expended.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

### Synthesis
Beginning when you reach 15th level in this class, you and
your companion can stay unified indefinitely, only reverting if
you fall unconscious, if you drop to 0 hit points, or if you die.

Additionally, while unified, you can make two attacks with
your companion's Strike as a bonus action, even if you don't
use your action to attack, and you have advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

# Magus
A half-elf, wielding her signature curved blade,
strides towards the orc raiding party. As the
nearest orc prepares to deflect the anticipated
strike, the elf waves her hand causing the blade
to ignite with flame. She deftly brings her blade
down as the fire engulfs her target.

A human scholar spends days poring over
countless tomes of ancient secrets and combat styles from
unknown lands. Finally, he grins as he is hit with an epiphany.
Grabbing his hand axe and whirling it in a defensive posture,
lightning crackles from the spinning metal. His research
complete, he seeks out a worthy opponent.

A tiefling in dark leathers peers from a rooftop under the
cover of darkness. He whispers an incantation under his
breath, as shadows engulf his quarry's eyes below. The
blinded target is unable to avoid the plunging blade.

All of these heroes are magi. Though individual magi are as
diverse as weapons and spells, all magi combine the martial
prowess of fighters with the arcane power of wizards.
Devoting their lives to the study of both schools, magi
combine blade and arcana with devastating effect. Many are
naturally drawn to adventure often seeking the chance to
perfect their craft or use their skills to benefit themselves or
others.

### Might and Magic
There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient
tomes and texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are
those who spend their time perfecting the use of individual
weapons, becoming masters without equal. The magus is at
once a student of both philosophies, blending magical ability
and martial prowess into something entirely unique, a
discipline in which both spell and steel are used to
devastating effect. As magi grow in power, they unlock
powerful forms of arcana that allow them to merge their
talents further, and at the pinnacle of their art, magi become
a blur of steel and magic, a force that few foes would dare to
stand against.
### Versatile Students
Magi spend much of their time traveling the world, learning
whatever secrets they can find. They might spend months
learning a new sword-fighting style from a master warrior,
while simultaneously moonlighting in the local library, poring
through tomes of ancient lore. Most who take this path
dabble in all sorts of knowledge, picking up anything that
might aid them in their search for martial and magical
perfection.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

### Creating a Magus
To create a magus, consider what drives your character to
develop their martial and magical prowess. Did something
happen to a loved one, instilling in you a need to protect
others? Do you have a rival, whom you must prove inferior?
Do you come from a family or tradition that expects absolute
perfection in the art of combat?

As a magus gains power, they refine their focus into a
particular magi study. Although the class features related to
your study don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead
for that choice by reading the study descriptions at the end of
the class. Are you a heavily-armored warrior, using magic to
supplement your powerful strikes? Are you a student of
witchcraft, using your arcane energies to curse and control
others? Or are you a devoted servant of a diety, trained to
purge evil from the land?

Finally, consider your motivations for pursuing adventure.
Are you adventuring to improve your mastery of martial
combat or arcane knowledge? To use your abilities for good?
Or maybe to prove yourself to your mentor or a parent figure?

#### Quick Build
You can make a magus quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your
highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose
the sage background. Third, choose
the fire bolt and shocking
grasp cantrips.

#### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**. To qualify for multiclassing with the
Magus class, you must meet these prerequisites: 13
Intelligence and 13 Strength or Dexterity.
<br>
**Proficiencies**. When you multiclass into the Magus
class, you gain the following proficiencies: Simple
weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor.
<br>
**Spell Slots**. You add half your Magus levels (rounded
down) to determine multiclass spell slots.

\page

### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic and martial technique, you
commit spells to memory for use even while engaged in
combat. See the magus spell list for the spells you can learn.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the
magus spell list. You learn additional magus cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column of the Magus table.

#### Spell Slots
The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your magus spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 2nd level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from
the magus spell list. Each time you gain a Magus Level, you
may learn one magus spell and replace one of the magus
spells you know with another spell of your choice from the
magus spell list. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots, as shown on the Magus table.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your magus spells.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a magus spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<div style="text-align:center;">

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
	
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your
magus spells.

### Spellstrike
At 1st level, you learn to deliver magical spells through melee
attacks. Once per round, when you perform a melee attack
and before you roll to hit, you may additionally cast a magus
spell as part of the attack action by expending a spell slot of
the spell's level or higher.

After choosing a spell, roll to hit as if attacking normally
with your weapon. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon
damage as well as the spell's effects. If the spell requires a
saving throw, the target makes its initial save at disadvantage.
On a miss, no weapon damage is dealt and the spell has no
effect. On a critical hit, both the weapon damage die and any
spell damage die are rolled twice and added together.

You may spellstrike a number of times per short rest equal to your proficiency bonus, and when you spellstrike using spell slots, you may only use spell slots granted to you by the Magus class.

#### Spellstrike Rules
- **Spell Action**: Spells used in spellstrike must have a
casting time of 1 action or bonus action and must not
normally require making a weapon attack.
- **Cantrips**: Cantrips can be cast as part of spellstrike and
do not require a spellslot to be expended. However,
cantrips cast this way deal damage as if cast by a
character of levels 1-4.
- **Area of Effect/Multiple Targets**: Spells that affect an
area or multiple targets instead only affect the creature
targeted with spellstrike.
- **Somatic Component**: Spells with a somatic component
may be cast with spellstrike while wielding a two-handed
or versatile weapon in both hands, or a single weapon in
each hand.

### Magus Arcana
At 2nd level, you learn to weave martial prowess with arcane
mastery, with hybrid abilities called "Magus Arcana." You
know two such abilities. When you reach levels 10 and 18,
you learn two more Arcana.

You may gain multiple features called Magus Acana that allow you to spend exertion when you successfully hit a creature. Only one such feature
may be used on each hit.

#### Fueling Magus Arcana
Magus Arcana cost exertion to use

#### Magus Arcana List
- **Arcane Accuracy**. As a bonus action, you may spend 1 exertion
to give yourself an expertise die on weapon attack rolls until the
end of your turn.
- **Critical Arcana**. When you critically hit with a weapon
attack, you may use your reaction and spend 2 exertion to stun
the target until the end of your next turn.
- **Hastened Arcana**. When you cast a spell with a casting
time of one action, you may spend 3 exertion to cast it as a
bonus action instead. Any additional spells cast on your
turn must be cantrips with a casting time of one action.
- **Arcane Rebuke**. As a reaction, when you take damage
from an attacker that you can see, you may spend 2 exertion to
cast a cantrip against that attacker.
- **Arcane Dodge**. You can spend 1 exertion to take the dodge
action as a bonus action.
\page
- **Elementalist Arcana**. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 exertion to add your Intelligence Modifier to your weapon damage (as cold, fire, or lightning) until the end of your
turn.
- **Arcane Vigor**. As a bonus action, spend 2 exertion to gain
temporary HP equal to double your Intelligence modifier.
- **Arcane Guise**. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 exertion to
add your Intelligence modifier to Stealth and Deception
checks you make for 1 minute.
- **Arcane Zeal**. You can spend 1 exertion to add your Intelligence
modifier to the result of an initiative roll you make.
- **Arcane Flow**. When casting a spell that requires you to
make an attack roll, you may use your bonus action and
spend exertion equal to 1 + the level of the spell cast (1 AP for
cantrips) to target an additional creature either within 5
feet of you or the initial target.

### Combat Maneuvers
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in Cutting Omen and one additional combat tradition from Arcane Knight, Tempered Iron or Razor's Edge. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You use your maneuvers by spending exertion points, and you gain an exertion pool of 2 times your Proficiency Bonus when you gain access to this feature, if you did not have one already.

The Maneuvers Known column of the Magus table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Magus Study
At 3rd level, you focus your research and practice to a refined
Magus Study. The study you choose grants you features at
levels 3, 7, 11, and 15.

The studies of the Warmage, Magister, Hexcrafter, Eldritch
Archer, Devoted Slayer, Stygian, and Primagus are shown
below.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice,
instead of once, whenever you take the attack
action on your turn.

You can replace one of those attacks with a
cantrip (cast as if you were levels 1-4).

<div style="margin-top:40px"></div>

### Magus' Shield
Beginning at 6th level, you can protect
yourself with magical energies. You gain
proficiency in constitution saving throws made
to maintain concentration on spells when you
take damage.

Also, whenever you have a free hand, you gain
a +2 bonus to AC, as if you were wielding a
shield. You lose this benefit until the beginning
of your next turn if you use that hand to wield
a weapon or otherwise manipulate an object

### Spell Study
At 7th level, you learn to hone your magic and spells to new power levels thanks to your dedicated studies. Choose one Spell Study that reflects what you have dedicated your arcane studies to. 

#### Arcane Objects
When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when hit by it, you are immediately aware that it’s magical. If you hold such an item in your hand, you can cast identify on it as an action without spending a spell slot, even if you don’t have the spell prepared. 

In addition, when you cast identify using a spell slot or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is cursed , and the Narrator will give you a hint as to the curse’s effects (which may be cryptic and vague, but must not be a lie).

#### Detective Spell Study
You are adept at sensing magic and its effects. If there are active magical effects near you, such as a spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, you automatically sense its presence. You don’t know what spell effects there are or where they are, but you can automatically sense the effect of magic in a 20-foot radius around you. 

In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add detect magic and detect thoughts to your spellbook if they weren’t already there. Whenever you cast detect magic , the range that you can sense magic is increased to 60 feet. Whenever you cast detect thoughts , the range of creatures that you can read thoughts from is increased to 60 feet.

#### Fauna And Flora
Your research into plants, wildlife, and the natural workings of magic grants you superior insights into the magic of living creatures and flora. When a plant or beast makes a saving throw against a spell that you cast, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage .

### Arcane Knowledge
At 10th level, you have expanded your arcane
knowledge to other disciplines. You may learn
two spells from any class list.
\page

The chosen spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots and count as magus
spells for you. You learn one more such spell at
levels 14 and 18.

### Improved Spellstrike
At 11th level, you improve your ability to deliver
damaging cantrips with your weapon. Beginning
at this level, your damaging cantrips are treated as
if you are levels 5-10 when cast with the spellstrike
or extra attack features.

### Spell Absorption
At 14th level, you learn to absorb harmful magical energies
into your weapon. When you take damage from a magical
spell or effect, you may spend 2 exertion and use your reaction to
reduce the incoming damage by 1d10 + your Intelligence
modifier + your magus level.

The magical damage you absorbed is stored in your
weapon and unleashed on your next hit. Before the end of
your next turn, when you first hit a creature with your
weapon, you deal additional damage equal to the amount
avoided. The damage type is the same as the original
triggering spell or effect.

Once you have absorbed magic into your weapon, you
cannot use this feature again until the magic has been
released through a successful attack or until it dissipates at
the end of your next turn.

### True Magus
At 20th level, you become a master of spells and combat. You
may use the spellstrike feature twice per round if at least one
of the spells used is a cantrip.

### Arcanomartial Studies

#### Air Lift
You can use an action to increase your vertical jump distance to 15 feet until the end of your turn. When you jump in this way, you can also glide with the updraft, allowing you to move 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you descend vertically.

#### Ascendant Step
*Prerequisite: 9th level*

You can cast levitate on yourself without spending spell points or material components.

#### Burst of Strength
You have moments of incredible strength. You may spend 1 exertion to add your proficiency bonus to a Strength check, even if you already add your proficiency bonus to the check. 

#### Detect Magic Savant
*Prerequisite: Able to cast detect magic*

Whenever you cast detect magic, you can choose one of the following benefits to amplify the spell.

**Lengthened Detect Magic**. The duration of detect magic is increased by 10 minutes.

**Extended Detect Magic**. The detection radius of detect magic is increased by 30 feet.

**Penetrating Detect Magic**. The spell can penetrate most barriers, and it is only blocked by 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of common metal, a 1-inch sheet of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt.

#### Eldritch Sight
You can cast detect magic without spending spell slots.

#### Illusion Detective
*Prerequisite: At least one illusion spell in your spellbook.*

You have advantage on Investigation checks and Intelligence saving throws made against illusion. When you succeed on an ability check or saving throw to see through an illusion, all allies within 30 feet of you gain advantage on checks to see through that illusion for the next minute.

#### Otherworldy Leap
You are under the constant effects of the jump spell. This effect does not emit a magical aura.

#### Persistent Mending
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast mending*

When you finish a long rest , choose up to 6 creatures who rested with you, including yourself. Choose one piece of their equipment to enchant with a persistent mending effect. The chosen item instantly fixes itself if it becomes damaged. If you choose an item from the following list, it also grants an additional benefit. This effect lasts for 12 hours.

**Coat**. Choose either hot or cold weather. The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to resist the effect of that kind of weather.

**Goggles**. The creature’s vision can never be reduced to less than 20 feet due to inclement weather.

**Shoes**. The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to undertake a forced march.

\page

#### Presto Prestidigitation
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast prestidigitation*

If you are not actively casting prestidigitation or concentrating on a spell, the magic of prestidigitation is always keeping you, your clothes, and your gear sparkling clean.

The following effects are added to the list of options you can choose from when you cast prestidigitation.

- You transmute a small piece of string in your hands into a sturdy 30-foot long rope. For the duration, it functions as a regular hempen rope.
- Using the heads side of a coin like a lens, you can hold the coin over one of your closed eyes and see through it. While looking through the coin in this way, you gain darkvision to a range of 30 feet. The coin’s darkvision effect ends when the spell ends.
- A pebble you touch becomes a sensor that you can use to see through. For the duration as long as you are within 10 feet of the pebble, you can use an action to see through the pebble to a range of 30 feet. While seeing through the pebble, you are blinded and deafened with regard to your own senses.
- On a piece of parchment or paper, you can create an exact copy of another piece of parchment or paper, including any writing, drawings, or other markings that appear on the original. The paper does not change size to accommodate any differences in size between the two. The copy you create lasts for the duration of this spell, and disappears when the spell ends.

#### Stable Footing
A steady stance and careful footwork is instinctive to you. You have advantage on any check or saving throw to avoid falling prone or handle difficult ground (such as against a grease spell or slippery ice). You are never prone after taking fall damage, and when calculating fall damage you treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number of feet equal to your proficiency bonus × 10.

## Magus Studies
Magi have varied focuses and preferences regarding their
magical and martial pursuits. These are grouped into
"studies" representing the different approaches taken by

## Study of The Eldritch Archer
An eldritch archer forgoes the typical focus on melee combat
to instead deliver spells through ranged weapons such as
bows or crossbows. They become masters of spellstriking,
able to cast all manner of dangerous spells through their
attacks.

### Ranged Spellstrike
At 3rd level, you learn to perform spellstrike attacks through
ranged weapons. Your spellstrike feature is modified to
additionally allow spellcasting with
ranged weapon attacks.

### Mystical Barrage
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use arcane energies to launch
multiple projectiles in one attack. When you use your action
to make an attack with a ranged weapon, you may expend 1
exertion to make one additional attack against the target creature
as part of your action.

After using focused barrage, all your subsequent attacks
must target that same creature until the end of your turn.
This feature cannot be performed if you previously made an
attack roll against a different creature on your current turn.

### Arcane Projectiles
Beginning at 7th level, you can imbue your ammunition with
elemental energies. Doing so requires 1 minute of time per
piece of ammunition enchanted. Projectiles enchanted in this
manner do an extra 1d6 fire, cold, lightning, acid, or poison
damage (your choice at the time of enchantment) when used
by the magus and lose their enchantment after being
used for an attack.

### Stunning Shot
At 11th level, you become adept at targeting
opponents weak points with magical energies. Once
per round, when you hit a creature with a ranged
weapon attack you may expend 2 exertion to attempt a
stunning shot. The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or
be stunned until the end of your next turn

### Perfected Spellstrike
At 15th level, you expand the repertoire of spells
you can deliver with your ranged attacks. When
you perform spellstrike with a ranged weapon,
you can choose to allow the spell to affect its
normal area instead of a single target.

The target of your projectile may be a
creature or a specific point in the environment.
If your target is a creature, they are considered
within the area of the spell on a hit and have
disadvantage on the spell's initial saving throw,
if applicable. If your target is a point in the
environment, your attack automatically hits.

Spells with an area of effect have their
point of origin where your projectile strikes.
For cone, cube, and line shaped spells, the
areas extend in the direction opposite of you.

The ranges of other spells (without a defined
area of effect) are similarly determined from
where your projectile strikes.

If your attack misses a creature, the DM
determines a reasonable location the
projectile lands and thus the location of the
spell's point of origin.

If you make a critical hit on a spellstrike
using a spell with an area of effect, only
the targeted creature takes critical
damage from the spell and weapon
attack. All other creatures in the spell's
area take normal damage from the spell.

## Study of the Hexcrafter
A hexcrafter magus has uncovered the secret of using their
arcane pool to recreate witch hexes. These magi can hex
foes, curse those they strike, and expand their spell selection
to include many curses and harmful spells.

### Expanded Hexcrafter Spell List
You gain access to the following spells, and may learn them
after you have reached the appropriate Magus level. They are
magus spells for you.

| Magus Level | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| 3rd               | hex, bane         |
| 5th               | enthrall, crown of madness|
| 9th               | remove curse, bestow curse|
| 13th              | blight, compulsion|
| 17th              | geas, circle of power|

\page
### Cursed Blade
At 3rd level, you learn to curse
your weapon to debilitate and
harm your opponents. You
learn a ritual that turns a
weapon of your choice into
a cursed item. The ritual is
performed over 1 hour
which can be done during a
short or long rest.

You can handle the cursed
weapon without incurring any
negative effect, but any other
creature who wields the
weapon must make a wisdom
saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failure, they
must make a roll on the short-term
madness table (located in the dungeon
master's guide). Anytime the creature
attempts a weapon attack with the cursed
weapon, they repeat the save and roll on
the madness table on a failure. The
madness effects take place before the
attack roll is made.

Another creature wielding the weapon
must use their action to make a wisdom
saving throw against your spell save DC
to willingly release the weapon. After
release, any madness remains for its duration
or until ended by a lesser restoration or remove
curse spell.

### Hexcrafter's Curse
Beginning at 3rd level, your cursed weapon can apply
minor hexes on contact. As a bonus action, when you hit a
creature with a weapon attack from the cursed weapon you
may spend 2 exertion to additionally cast hex at 1st level on them
without expending a spell slot. When cast this way, if the
target drops to 0 hit points, hex cannot be transferred to a
new target.

At higher levels you gain the ability to cast new spells with
this feature. Spells cast with this feature do not require
concentration.

### Improved Hex
At 7th level, you have attained mastery of common curses.
Instead of 1d6, you now deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to
targets under the effect of your hex spell. This damage
increases to 1d10 at 11th level and 1d12 at 15th level.

### Advanced Curse
At 11th level, the curses applied by your weapon intensify,
blinding the senses of its target. You may now spend 3 exertion to
cast blindness/deafness at 2nd level in place of hex for the
hexcrafter's curse feature.

### Dreadful Curse
At 15th level, your weapon can deliver devastating curses. You
may now spend 4 AP to cast bestow curse at 3rd level instead
for the hexcrafter's curse feature.


## Study of the Magister
In direct contrast to the warmage study, a magister
develops their spellcasting beyond that of the other magi
studies. Magisters see the pursuit of arcane power as the
ultimate means to perfection.

### Arcana Flux
At 3rd level, you learn to bend your magical reserves to suit
your purposes. You can use your exertion to gain
additional spell slots.

**Creating Spell Slots**. You can transform unexpended
arcane points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your
turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of
creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots
no higher in level than 5th. Spell slots created in this way cease to exist after a short rest

| Exertion Cost | Spell SlotLevel |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|
| 2                 | 1st   |
| 3                 | 2nd   |
| 5                 | 3rd   |
| 6                 | 4th   |
| 7                 | 5th   |


**Converting a Spell Slot to Exertion**. As a bonus
action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a
number of exertion equal to the slot’s level.

### Font of Mana
Beginning at 3rd level, through practice you have developed
your magical reserves further than most. You gain additional
spell slots at the following levels. These replenish with your
other spell slots.
- At 3rd level, you gain an additional level 1 Spell Slot.
- At 7th level, you gain an additional level 2 Spell Slot.
- At 11th level, you gain an additional level 3 Spell Slot.

### Deep Arcane Knowledge
At 7th level, you learn two spells from any class list. The
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots and
count as magus spells for you.

When you gain a magus level, you may replace one of the
spells obtained with this feature for another.

### Empowered Magic
Beginning at 11th level, you can empower your spells with
arcane energy. You may spend 1 exertion to add your Intelligence
modifier to the damage of a magus spell you cast.

### Arcane Restoration
Beginning at 15th level, once per short rest, you may
replenish an amount of Exertion up to your Intelligence Modifier as
a bonus action. At any time, your current exertion cannot exceed
your maximum exertion pool.

\page

## Study of the Primagus
While many magi learn magic through formal study, there are
those who draw power from natural sources. These magi are
often wise people or shamans for tribal groups who use their
knowledge of nature and tribal tradition to produce magic
and fight alongside their fellow warriors.

### Natural Magic
At 3rd level, you begin using your knowledge of nature and its
creatures to power your magic. You gain proficiency in nature
(or another magus class skill if already proficient).

In addition, when your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a
magus spell, you can choose the new spell from the ranger
spell list or the magus spell list. These are magus spells for
you.

### Boon of the Hunt
Beginning at 3rd level, your arcane blows inspire ancestor
warrior spirits to empower your war party. When you hit a
creature with a weapon attack, you may spend 1 AP to grant
an ally within 10ft of yourself advantage on attack rolls until
the beginning of your next turn.

### Feral Skill
At 7th level, you infuse your martial capabilities with passed-
down techniques learned anciently from the wild. Choose one
of the following options.

#### Fortitude of the Bear
Once per short rest, when a creature hits you and deals
damage, you may use your reaction to take only
half as much damage.

#### Agility of the Elk
Once per short rest, when you fail a dexterity saving throw,
you may use your reaction to succeed instead.

#### Ferocity of the Wolf
Once per short rest, when you hit a creature, you may choose
to roll your weapon damage die twice and add them together
for that attack.

#### Shrewdness of the Owl
Once per short rest, when you miss a melee attack roll, you
may choose to reroll the attack.

#### Nerve of the Hawk
Once per short rest, if you fail a check to maintain
concentration on a spell, you may choose to succeed instead.

### Empowering Ritual
At 11th level, you have created a ritual to bolster your allies
before a fight. Once per long rest, you and up to 10 allies may
participate in the ritual which takes 10 minutes. This can be
done as part of a long or short rest. Each creature that
participates gains temporary hit points equal to half your
magus level (rounded down) plus your intelligence modifier.

### Wild Arcana
At 15th level, you begin applying arcane power to your nature-
inspired martial techniques. Your may now use your chosen
feral skill technique more than once per short rest, however,
every subsequent use after the first requires spending exertion.
Additional uses of Ferocity of the Wolf require 1 exertion,
all other techniques require 2 exertion.


## Study of the Stygian
Some magi, known as stygians, learn to blend shadowfell
magic with their martial training, letting them stay unnoticed
as they take down foes.

### Shadow Weaver
At 3rd level, you learn to guide shadows to magically conceal
yourself. You gain proficiency in stealth (or another magus
class skill if already proficient). Whenever you make a stealth
check, you may add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

Additionally, whenever you cast a spell, you may spend 1
exertion to cast it silently, without verbal components.

### Arcane Cloak
Beginning at 3rd level, you use
arcane energy to render yourself
briefly invisible. When you move on
your turn, you may spend 1 exertion to
become invisible until the
beginning of your next turn. This
invisibility ends early when you
attack or cast a spell.

Creatures who know you are
present may make a perception
check on their turn against your spell
save DC to know your location (no
action required). On a success, that
creature may attack you at
disadvantage. Creatures whom you
attacked on your last turn have
advantage on the perception check.

You may use arcane cloak out of
combat when turns are not closely
tracked. In these situations,
arcane cloak lasts 6 seconds
(unless it ends early). You may
spend additional exertion to extend the
invisibility by an additional 6
seconds per AP spent.

### Void Sight
Beginning at 7th level, your
expertise with shadow allows you to
see clearly through darkness and
partially see through invisibility. You
gain darkvision for 60 feet, and can
see through magical darkness. If you
already have darkvision, the range
increases by 30 feet.

\page

Additionally, you
can see the vague outline of invisible
creatures and objects within 30 feet of you,
allowing you to know their location. Your attacks
against invisible creatures are still made with
disadvantage.

### Lingering Shadow
Beginning at 11th level, shadows cling to your form even
when you are no longer invisible. Whenever the invisibility
from your arcane cloak ends early, attacks against you have
disadvantage until the beginning of your next turn.

### Nightblade's Strike
Beginning at 15th level, your mastery of stealth and arcana
allow you to deliver devastating strikes suffused with harmful
shadowfell magic. Once per round, when you have advantage
on an attack roll, you may spend 3 AP to automatically hit
before you make the attack roll. You may still roll to attack
after choosing to perform this feature to determine if you
make a critical hit.

An attack performed this way deals an additional 2d6
necrotic damage a number of times equal to your intelligence
modifier (for example, if you have +3 as your intelligence
modifier, you deal an additional 6d6 necrotic damage).

## Study of the Warmage
The warmage is a skilled specialist, using magic to
supplement and augment their martial mastery. They are
somewhat less inclined towards magical development than
other magi, and instead seek supremacy with blade and
armor.

### Armor Bond
At 3rd level, when you choose this study, you gain proficiency
in heavy armor.

In addition, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond
between yourself and one set of armor. You perform the ritual
over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short
or long rest. The armor must be within your reach
throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch
the armor and forge the bond. You can only bond with one set
of armor at a time; to bond with new armor you must break
your bond with the original armor as part of the ritual.

Once you have bonded armor to yourself, you no longer
need to don and doff the armor as normal. Instead, as long as
your bonded armor is on the same plane of existence, you can
summon your armor as a bonus action on your turn, causing
it to appear instantly on your body. Similarly, as a bonus
action, you can dismiss the armor to a familiar location of
your choice.

### Warmage's Strike
Beginning at 3rd level, you can augment the damage of your
weapon attacks with raw arcana. When you hit a creature
with a weapon attack, you may spend exertion to deal force
damage equal to 1d6 per exertion spent plus your intelligence
modifier. You may spend a number of exertion up to half your
magus level (rounded down)
to use this feature.

### Fighting Style
At 7th level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take
a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get
to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no
other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that
weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two
hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even
if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-
handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you
that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding
a shield or have increased AC from the magus' shield feature.

### Arcane Sunder
Beginning at 11th level, your weapon strikes can undercut a
creature’s resistance to spells. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you may spend 2 exertion to give that creature
disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes to resist a
spell before the end of your next turn.

### Mind and Body
At 15th level, you learn to use your extensive martial
knowledge to give yourself an edge in physical activities.
When you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability
check or saving throw, you may use your reaction to add your
Intelligence modifier to the result. This can be done a
number of times per long rest
equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum
of once).

## Study of the Vanquisher
Unlike other magus studies, vanquishers study the will of the
divine to fuel magical attacks. Much like paladins and clerics,
vanquishers are often sworn to the service of a diety and
spend their lives in pursuit of heavenly knowledge.

\page

### Divine Magic
At 3rd level, you begin calling upon divine powers to fuel your
magic. You gain proficiency in religion or another magus
class skill if already proficient.

In addition, when you learn a magus spell, you can choose
the new spell from the paladin spell list or the magus spell
list. These are magus spells for you.

### Restorative Strike
Beginning at 3rd level, you can unleash bursts of divine
healing with your strikes. When you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack, you may spend exertion to regain hit points
equal to 1d6 per AP spent plus your intelligence modifier. You
may spend a number of exertion up to half your magus level
(rounded down) to use this feature.

### Student of the Heavens
At 7th level, you have learned much about the
creatures that inhabit the many planes through your
studies. You have advantage on intelligence ability checks
to recall information about aberrations, celestials,
elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

Possible information known about these creatures
includes their abilities, strongest/weakest ability scores, etc.
in addition to general facts about a creature's behavior and
history.

### Spiritual Devotion
Beginning at 11th level, your dedication to heavenly
principles empowers you with holy protection. When you take
damage, you may use your reaction and spend 2 exertion to give
yourself resistance to the triggering damage.

### Blessed Slayer
At 15h level, you have expanded your knowledge of the planes
and the creatures within them and are prepared to end those
who defy the holy standards of your worship.

You have
advantage on melee attack rolls against creatures of the
following types: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends,
and undead.

In addition, those creatures have disadvantage on
intelligence, wisdom, and charisma saving throws to resist
your spells and features.

# Oracle
A young woman, clutching her walking stick for
support, wanders a lonely road. She hears
snarling some distance behind her and turns to
see a wolf pack beginning to circle. Unhurried,
she extends her hand as a barrage of ghostly
figures assaults the pack. Turning back around,
she continues on her way.

A dwarvish man with clouded eyes stands amongst his
adventuring companions as they wait to see his magic. He
looks to the sun, his eyes now glowing brightly as the vision
begins. A moment passes, his eyes fade and he nods to his
crew pointing further down the path in the direction of their
quarry.

As a furious mob rounds the corner, a fleeing elf with
impossibly pale almost transparent skin weaves a spell. In an
instant, she disappears from sight amongst the darkness.

Oracles are granted great power from divine sources, but
this power is given against their will. In return for their divine
abilities, oracles pay the price as their mortal forms are
cursed by this same divine power. Desiring to understand
their newfound magic and curse, oracles are driven to seek
out hidden knowledge of divine mysteries and are granted
increased power as they do so.

### Divine Curse
Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none
is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are
granted power without their choice, selected by providence to
wield powers that even they do not fully understand. This
power comes at a cost, however, and their body and spirit are
irreparably cursed. Unlike a cleric, who draws magic through
devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from
many sources, namely those patron deities who support their
ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to
venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some
see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a
curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.

### Mystery Seekers
Oracles are a rare sight in civilized society as their curse and
strange powers make it difficult to live an ordinary life. At
best, oracles are revered as blessed individuals, looked
up to for their divine abilities. At worst, they are feared
and cast out by those who don't trust their cursed
state.

Oracles do not usually associate with any one
church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on
their own, or with a small group of like-minded
individuals. They typically use their spells and
revelations to further their understanding of their
mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles, tending
to the poor and sick, or uncovering lost lore. In an
adventuring party, oracles provide a powerful
connection to a variety of divine sources to
support their allies and afflict their foes.

### Creating an Oracle
To create an oracle, look at your choices in the Oracle Curses
section and consider the relationship between your curse and
your magical abilities. Does same power that fuels your spells
also overwhelm and debilitate your physical body? Or instead,
perhaps you are under obligation to a divine being or
pantheon of beings and they maintain the curse to exert some
control?

Determine your mystery and why you are pursuing that
particular knowledge. Does it relate to your curse or do you
have some other personal stake in acquiring that knowledge?
Or maybe you have always been infatuated with your chosen
mystery independent of becoming an oracle?

Lastly, determine why you have chosen the life of an
adventurer? Will it get you closer to your goal of obtaining
knowledge about your mystery? Were you ostracized by your
homeland and forced to follow a transient life? Or did you
find it difficult to keep your magic dormant and needed an
outlet for your divine power?

#### Quick Build
You can make an oracle quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability
score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte
background and the clouded curse. Third, choose the
guidance, light, and toll the dead cantrips,
along with the 1st-level spells bless and
detect magic

#### Multiclassing
**Prerequisites**. To qualify for multiclassing with the Oracle
class, you must meet these prerequisites: 13 Charisma.
<br>
**Proficiencies**. When you multiclass into the Oracle class,
you gain the following proficiencies: Simple weapons, light
armor.
<br>
**Spell Slots**. You add all your Oracle levels for the purposes
of determining multiclass spell slots

### Spellcasting
Beginning at 1st level, you cast spells drawn from a multitude
of divine sources.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the
oracle spell list. You learn additional oracle cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column of the Oracle table

#### Spell Slots
The Oracle table shows how many
spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these Oracle spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
\page
#### Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the oracle
spell list. The Spells Known column of the Oracle table
shows when you learn more oracle spells of your choice from
this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots on the oracle table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the oracle spells you know from this feature
and replace it with another spell from the oracle spell list.
The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell
slots on the Oracle table.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your oracle spells.
You use your charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an oracle spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<div style="text-align:center;">

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast an oracle spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you know the spell.
#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an oracular focus as a spellcasting focus for your
oracle spells.

### Oracle's Curse
Each oracle is bound by some curse, but this curse comes
with benefits as your powers grow.

At 1st level, you choose a curse from the list of Oracle's
curses. This curse cannot be removed or dispelled without
the aid of a deity. Your choice of curse grants you additional
features at levels 3, 10, and 18

### Epiphany
Beginning at 2nd level, you have an inherent inclination
towards divining hidden secrets and lost knowledge. Once
per long rest, you may cast the spell augury as a bonus action.
This represents a sudden flash of knowledge bestowed by
some divine source, and it only takes the duration of your
bonus action to ask your question and receive an answer
from the spell. Spells cast this way do not require expending
a spell slot or using material components.

Beginning at 7th level, you may cast divination in place of
augury. Beginning at 13th level, you may cast commune
instead. When you cast commune this way, you may only ask
one question during the initial bonus action. However, you
may use your bonus action on subsequent turns to ask your
remaining questions until the spell ends

### Mystery
At 2nd level, you dedicate yourself to a divine mystery to
explore and understand. The mystery you choose grants you
features at levels 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18.

In addition, you gain spells according to your chosen
mystery at the appropriate oracle levels. Each of these spells
counts as an oracle spell for you, but do not count against the
number of oracle spells you know.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20
using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this
feature to take a feat of your choice instead

### Sacred Office
Also at 4th level, your mission has taken root and is known through much of the land, conveying rumors both good and ill about your deeds. Choose one of the following. 

#### Auspicious Collaborator
The higher powers you are attuned to have witnessed your deeds and bestowed upon you a quality of worthiness. Your requests for aid are perceived as opportunities for partnership rather than impositions.

People of all backgrounds are more drawn to help you than they would ordinarily be. You gain one specialty chosen from Culture or Persuasion, and you gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks related to seeking aid.

#### Divine Authority
Your connection to divine entities opens many doors. Sermons you give and courtesy calls you make to different religious groups put you in contact with a local representative of your faith, who is happy to strongly recommend you to another local leader. You gain one specialty chosen from Culture, Insight, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Culture, Insight, and Persuasion checks made against local leaders to whom you are recommended that would otherwise be indifferent towards you.

#### Engaging Proclaimer
Your recitations of divine stories, songs, or chants quickly build and hold an audience’s attention, whether you are speaking to a packed tavern or a smaller gathering. You gain an expertise die on Performance checks to gather and hold the attention of 2 or more people. In addition, you gain two skill specialties, chosen from Performance and Religion.

\page

#### Reputation
Your reputation for talented ministry and good works precedes you. Common folk frequently recognize you on sight, and those who do often have a friendly disposition towards you. They often ask you for counsel, favors, and blessings. The disposition of people they introduce you to are one stage better than normal (the indifferent become friendly, the hostile become indifferent).

#### Symbol Of Might
The strength of the powers you serve is obvious to anybody you interact with, and you are able to use it to garner a certain level of fear and compliance. You gain one Intimidation specialty, and you gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks made to convince others to comply with your demands. The people you intimidate are no longer friendly towards you, if they were previously. 

#### Divine Presence
At 9th level, you bring the true presence of your divinity wherever you go. Choose one of the following.

#### Cosmic Idealist
Your moral compass aligns with the transcendent forces of the multiverse. Choose Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, or one of the following: Chaotic and Evil, Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Lawful and Good. You gain the chosen alignment trait or alignment traits. You can identify creatures that have the same alignment traits as you, and you have advantage when making Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks against them.

Additionally, you do not suffer negative effects from being on a plane with which you share an alignment trait.

#### Eyes of the Heart
You have a way of really seeing folk’s inner character. When you succeed on a contested Insight check, if the opposing creature’s Charisma score is equal to or less than your spell save DC, for the next 24 hours you do not need to make any further checks to recognize whenever that creature is lying, telling the truth, or excluding information. 

#### Spiritual Salve
Your spiritual mindset has given you unique insights that can help you and your companions endure hardships. Your constant encouragements and proverbs allow allies within 30 feet of you to reroll a Constitution check or saving throw that they fail. If they do so, they must use the new roll. This feature cannot be used on saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell. Once a creature has used your Spiritual Salve to make a reroll, it cannot do so again until it has finished a long rest.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

### Providence
At 10th level, the potency of your faith increases. Choose one of the following.

#### Divine Intervention 
Beginning at 10th level, you can use an action to call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Describe the assistance you seek and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The Narrator chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric archetype spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest . 

After each failed divine intervention roll, add 1 to the number required to succeed until it is a success, at which point it resets to your cleric level or below.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

#### Prayer of Protection
After each long rest choose one damage type from the following list: cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, psychic, radiant, or thunder. You gain resistance to this damage type until the end of your next long rest. 

### Revelation
At 20th level, your ability to reveal deep lore and ancient
secrets is unmatched. When you cast the spells augury,
divination, or commune, you may ask one additional question
as part of the spell.

With the epiphany feature, your additional question is
asked as part of the initial bonus action, regardless of the
spell used.

### Signs of Divinity

#### Ancestral Guidance
In addition to the spells you normally prepare, you always have speak with dead prepared, and you can use this feature to cast it once between long rests without spending a spell slot. When you do so, you do not have to target a corpse; you can also target a grave marker, memorial, statue, painting, or other depiction of the deceased creature you wish to talk to. If the chosen creature is not dead, or if such a creature never existed in the first place, the spell fails.

#### Bedside Manner
Your insight and sympathy more than make up for your lack of formal medical training. You gain an expertise die on Medicine checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Charisma when making Medicine checks.

\page

#### Bread and Fish
Your greater entity acts as a buffer to shield you from hardship, Preventing the first level of fatigue you would take each day.

#### Gentle Healer
During a short rest , you can spend uses from your healer’s satchel to aid your allies in their recovery. A creature you choose may roll expended Hit Dice twice, taking the higher result. You may not expend your own Hit Dice while using this feature, since you use all of your energies to heal your companions.

#### Graceful Fall
Falling from a height greater than 30 feet causes your greater entity to intervene. You are protected as if by the feather fall spell. This sign does not use your reaction. 

#### Miraculous Discovery
You gain an expertise die on Investigation checks, and your passive Investigation score increases by 3. Additionally, you can always choose to use your Charisma when making Investigation checks.

#### Numinous Awareness
When you see a creature that appears to be a beast, you automatically recognize whether it is a celestial, fiend, or fey. You have advantage on Arcana and Medicine checks made to interact with magical wounds and maladies caused by celestials, fiends, and fey.

#### Premonition
You have the ability to interpret messages sent to you in dreams or visions by your greater entity. After each long rest you know either:

- a piece of information that will help you in your endeavours before the end of your next long rest,

- or, how one action will play out before the end of your next long rest. Roll a d20. Before the end of your next long rest, you may choose to replace any roll made by a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you with the result of this d20 roll.

The Narrator lets you know which benefit is available whenever you finish a long rest.


#### Preservation
Your connection to a greater entity allows you to sense poison or disease in food, drink, or other consumables. You must have had direct contact with them or their container in order to sense this corruption.

#### Prophetic Protection
Whenever you would trigger a trap, the Narrator makes a secret Charisma (Perception) check against the DC to spot the trap. On a success, you do not spot the trap but get a strong sense that moving any further will put you in danger. 

#### Righteous Path
Divine intuition guides you through the tangled paths of constructed or inhabited areas without confusion. Once per day you may choose to walk the Righteous Path for 1 hour. While walking the Righteous Path, you are aware when enemies are within 60 feet of you, and you know if backtracking or alternate routes could avoid them. You can also use an action to sense if there are traps within 30 feet, but not the location or nature of the traps

#### Seek Truths
You gain an expertise die on Insight checks made to discern the truth. In addition, after you have made a successful Insight check opposed by a creature’s Deception check, you have advantage on Insight checks made against it for 24 hours.

#### Soothing Words
Your divinely-inspired counsel and wise advice can calm troubled minds. You may reduce one ally’s strife by one level. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. 

#### Supernal Intuition
Choose a creature type from fiend, fey, celestial, elemental, or undead. You know when a creature of this type is within 60 feet of you, although you do not know its location. Nondetection protects against this feature. You may select this sign multiple times, choosing a different creature type each time.

#### Voice of Doom
Your personal knowledge of divine wrath and the end times make your proclamations utterly chilling. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making Intimidation checks.

assist the oracle in a variety of ways including granting advice
or protecting them from harm

### Ancestor Mystery Spells
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|

blade or booming blade (your choice). In

weapon from your ancestral history without
using an action. This weapon deals 1d8
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your
choice) and has a 5 foot range. You may use your
charisma modifier on attack and damage rolls with
the weapon, and you are considered proficient with it.
You can summon your weapon a number of times per
day equal to your charisma modifier. The weapon
disappears after 1 minute, after 1 round if it leaves your
grasp, or when you dismiss it as a bonus action.

### Sacred Council

your ancestors to provide council. This advice grants
you advantage on your next ability check within one
minute. You can use this ability a number of times per

can become incorporeal and invisible. While in this form, you

one minute or until you use your action to end the effect.

you, assisting in every strike and spell against your foes. You

Oracles of bone study death and undeath to grant themselves
greater power over the mysteries of life, especially its end.
Like life oracles, bone oracles seek to fathom life but do so to
manipulate death rather than bestow health.

### Bone Mystery Spell
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| 2nd               | Sleep, Hideous Laughter|

At 2nd level, you animate a humanoid corpse with undeath to
serve you. This servant grows in power as you do. If your
servant dies, you can spend your downtime during a long rest
to reanimate it. Your servant is dismissed if you die.

Your undead servant uses the stat block on this page,
which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the undead servant shares your initiative count,
but it takes its turn immediately after yours.

\page
Unless
commanded otherwise, the servant approaches and attacks
the nearest hostile creature that it has a clear path to (if two
or more enemies are an equal distance away, you choose
which your servant approaches).

You may use your bonus action to mentally command the
servant to perform a different simple task, such as attacking a
different target, taking the dodge action, dashing in a certain
direction, or following you or another creature

### Voice of the Grave
Beginning at 6th level, once per long rest, you can use your
action to cast the spell Speak With Dead without expending a
spell slot. When cast this way, you may ask a number of
questions equal to your charisma modifier.

### Armor of Bones
Beginning at 10th level, you can use the bones of a dead
medium or larger creature to conjure bone armor onto your
body as an action. Bone armor has the same characteristics
as scale mail, but counts as light armor for the purposes of
proficiency, does not give disadvantage to stealth checks, and
weighs 15 pounds. When removed, this armor falls apart into
the original set of bones used in its creation.

condition.

## Dragon Mystery
Oracles seeking the mysteries of the dragons learn to become
more like the majestic creatures. Channeling draconic power,
an oracle may learn to take flight, breathe magical energy, or
shrug off attacks with scaled skin

### Dragon Mystery Spells
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| 2nd               | Absorb Elements, Cause Fear|
| 3rd               | Dragon's Breath, Augury|
| 5th               | Fly, Protection from Energy|
| 7th               | Freedom of Movement, Divination|
| 9th               | Summon Draconic Spirit, Commune|

### Draconic Resistance
Beginning at 2nd level, like the great dragons, you are not
easily harmed or injured. You gain resistance to a chosen
damage type (either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison). In
addition, you have advantage on constitution saving throws
against magic.

### Dragon Sense
At 6th level, your senses take on a keen draconic edge. You
gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet (or increase the range
of your darkvision by 30 feet). In addition, you have advantage
on perception checks involving sight

### Imbued Magic
At 10th level, the primal power of dragonkind seethes within
you imbuing your magic with destructive or protective
draconic energy. When you cast a non-cantrip spell, you may
choose one of the two following options:
You deal damage equal to half your oracle level (rounded
down) plus your charisma modifier to one creature of your
choice that is hit by the spell or in its area of effect. The
damage is the type chosen for the "draconic resistance"
feature.

\page

Choose one creature of your choice that is targeted by the
spell or in its area of effect. That creature gains temporary
hit points equal to half your oracle level (rounded down)
plus your charisma modifier.

### Dragon Wings
Beginning at 14th level, like the great dragons, you can take
to the skies and terrorize opponents from above. As a bonus
action, you can manifest leathery dragon wings that grant you
a flying speed equal to your current speed. They last until you
dismiss them as a bonus action.

### Draconic Presence
Beginning at 18th level, those who would oppose are struck
with terror at your draconic majesty. Once per long rest, as a
bonus action, you can exude an aura of awe or fear (your
choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose
your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in
this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or be charmed (if you chose awe)
or frightened (if you chose fear)
until the aura ends

## Life Mystery
Oracles that pursue the mysteries of life itself gain the power
to heal and restore themselves and allies. They become so
attuned with the essence of life they can detect the presence
of living creatures, prevent disease, and direct the flow of
damage and healing in combat.

### Life Mystery Spells
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| 2nd               | Cure Wounds, Healing Word|
| 3rd               | Lesser Restoration, Augury|
| 5th               | Aura of Vitality, Revivify|
| 7th               | Aura of Life, Divination|
| 9th               | Greater Restoration, Commune|

### Health Bond
Beginning at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you may create a
bond between yourself and another willing creature. At the
start of your turn, if the bonded creature has taken damage
since the beginning of your last turn, it heals an amount of hit
points equal to half the damage taken. You then take necrotic
damage equal to half the amount of hit points healed, which
ignores resistance or immunity.

You may have one bond active at a time. This bond
continues until you or the bonded creature are reduced to 0
hit points or you choose to end it (requires no action)

### Purifying Aura
Beginning at 6th level, allied creatures (including yourself)
within 20 feet of you have advantage on saving throws to
resist disease or poison.

### Life Given and Taken
At 10th level, you learn to draw the life energy out of your foes
and into your allies. When you heal a creature through a spell
or the health bond feature, you also deal necrotic damage
equal to half your oracle level (rounded down) plus your
charisma modifier to all creatures of your choice within 5 feet
of the healed target.

### Lifesense
Beginning at 14th level, you notice and locate living and
undead creatures within 30 feet, as if you had blindsense. You
can distinguish which creatures are living or undead.

### Healing Spirit

Beginning at 18th level, once per long rest, when you cast a
spell that requires an action, you may become a beacon of
pure healing energy. Once per round, while in this form, a
creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of you or moves to
within 5 feet of you automatically heals a number of hit points
equal to 1d12 plus your charisma modifier, without requiring
an action. When a creature is healed this way, you also heal
the same number of hit points.

You may choose not to heal a creature, and you choose
which creature (if any) is healed if there are multiple
applicable targets at one time. You remain in this form for 1
minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you use a bonus
action to end the effect.

## Lunar Mystery
Individuals whose mysterious, divine powers are intimately
linked to the moon, dreams, and madness, lunar oracles find
inspiration and insight in lunar light.

### Lunar Mystery Spells
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| 2nd               | Sleep, Hideous Laughter|
| 3rd               | Moonbeam, Augury|
| 5th               | Enemies Abound, Crown of Madness|
| 7th               | Confusion, Divination|
| 9th               | Dream, Commune|

### Touch of Mana
Beginning at 2nd level, through subtle
enchantment, your spells seem particularly
effective to your allies but only in their mind.

Once per round, when you cast a spell, you
may choose a creature that was targeted by
the spell or in its area of effect. That
creature gains a number of temporary
hitpoints equal to twice the spell's level. If
the spell deals damage, the temporary hit
points are applied after the damage is taken.
These temporary hit points expire after 1
minute.

\page

Only one creature may benefit from these
temporary hit points at a time. If you grant
temporary hit points to a second creature, the
first loses theirs.

### Nocturnal Companion
At 6th level, you gain the service of a
faithful animal of the night. As an action,
you can cast the spell find familiar without
material components to summon this
companion, which takes the form of a
nocturnal animal (your choice upon casting),
has the stats of a creature of your choice in the
find familiar spell, and is fey.

As an action, when your familiar is in dim light or
darkness, you can cause it to become invisible.
The invisibility lasts until the familiar enters an
area of bright light. Your familiar has proficiency
in stealth checks and uses your charisma modifier
for them in place of dexterity.

### Moonlight Mantle
Beginning at 10th level, like the moon itself, you
illusively reflect light to illude your foes. Once per short
rest, as a bonus action, you can cause the effects of the
mirror image spell on a willing creature that you can see,
without expending a spell slot or requiring concentration.

### Moonlight Script
Beginning at 14th level, during each long rest, while you sleep
or trance, your hands produce mysterious writing that
pertains to the future. This takes the form of a divination spell
with two available questions. Both questions are asked before
an answer to either has been received.

### Lunacy
Beginning at 18th level, your spells carry with them the taint
of madness. Once per round, when you cast a non-cantrip
spell, you may choose one creature that was hit by the spell or
in its area of effect to make a wisdom saving throw against
your spell save DC. If a creature fails a saving throw to resist
the spell, it automatically fails this wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, that creature suffers the effects of the
confusion spell and may attempt a wisdom saving throw at
the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

On a successful
save to resist or end the effect, the creature is immune to this
ability for 24 hours.

## Solar Mystery
Aimless wanderers and restless nomads, oracles of the solar
mystery uncover meaning in the ever-changing positions of
the sun and the stars in the sky. They draw power from the
lights in the firmament to magically travel, enlighten hidden
secrets, and burn their foes.

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

### Solar Mystery Spells
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| 2nd               | Faerie Fire, Guiding Bolt|
| 3rd               | Flaming Sphere, Augury|
| 5th               | Daylight, Fireball|
| 7th               | Dimension Door, Divination|
| 9th               | Dawn, Commune|

### Blistered Caress
At 2nd level, you learn to channel the hostile, unforgiving heat
of the sun into your magic. You learn the cantrip fire bolt,
which does not count against your oracle cantrips known.
In addition, spells you cast of 1st level or higher deal
additional fire damage equal to your charisma modifier to
creatures of your choice affected by the spell.

### Sungazer
Beginning at 6th level, you can study the sun and gaze upon
any place light touches. Once per short rest, you may cast the
spell clairvoyance, but only for visual observation and you can
only place your sensor in places currently being touched by
bright light.
At 10th level, you may use the spell scrying to observe a
creature or location touched by bright light instead.
If a spell cast with this feature fails due to the target not
being in bright light, your use of this ability is not expended.

### Starlight Agility
Beginning at 10th level, you effortlessly weave
and dodge like light from a flickering flame. If
you move at least 15 feet in a straight line
during your turn, creatures have disadvantage on
attack rolls against you until the beginning of
your next turn.

### Sun Stride
Beginning at 14th level, you can travel
between areas of bright light, granting you the
following benefits:
- As a bonus action, you may teleport
to a location with bright light,
bringing along objects or a willing
creature (following the requirements
of the dimension door spell). You can
sun stride a number of feet per long
rest equal to 20 times your charisma
score (not modifier).
- You gain the ability to sense locations
of bright light within 100 feet.

### Luminous Form
Beginning at 18th level, once per
long rest, you can transform your
body into violently churning light as
a bonus action, granting you the
effects of the spell blur and causing
your body to shed bright light for a
range of 30 feet and dim light an
additional 30 feet.

\page

Creatures that end their turn
within 10 feet of your luminous
form must make a constitution
saving throw against your spell
save DC or be blinded for 1d4
rounds. This form lasts for one
minute or until you end it as a bonus
action or fall unconscious.

## Winter Mystery
Winter oracles draw upon the powers of cold and snow in
their spells and abilities. Their magic is as debilitating as
freezing northern winters, slowing and blinding the oracle's
foes to protect themselves and their allies.

### Winter Mystery Spell
| Oracle Level      | Spells |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
| 2nd               | Frost Fingers, Ice Knife|
| 3rd               | Rime's Binding Ice, Augury|
| 5th               | Sleet Storm, Slow|
| 7th               | Ice Storm, Divination|
| 9th               | Cone of Cold, Commune|

### Snow Flurry
At 2nd level, your learn to manipulate cold and snow. You
learn the cantrip ray of frost, which does not count against
your oracle cantrips known.

In addition, once per round, when you target a creature
with a spell, you may choose to create a flurry of snow around
them that lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
Creatures affected by the snow flurry are lightly obscured,
and ranged attacks against those
creatures are made with
disadvantage

### Commune with Winter
At 6th level, you learn to draw knowledge and insight from
snowfall and ice. Once per long rest, in icy or snowy terrain,
you may cast the spell commune with nature as an action
without expending a spell slot. You may alternatively perform
this feature in other terrain types, but you only learn one fact
of your choice from those listed in the spell.

### Icy Armor
Beginning at 10th level, you can freeze water around yourself
to gain a layer of icy protection. Once per long rest, as an
action, you can summon this ice armor which can be worn on
top of regular armor and lasts for 1 hour. While wearing the
armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire
damage.
If you take at least 20 points of fire damage at one time
(before resistance), the armor melts and must be recreated to
receive its benefits again. You still have resistance to the
instance of fire damage that melted it.

### Blizzard Soul
At 14th level, you become one with cold and winter, granting
you the following benefits:
- Both magical and nonmagical fog, clouds, sleet, rain,
snow, etc. do not obscure or block your sight.
- You gain resistance to cold damage.
- You do not suffer any negative effects caused by a cold
environment.

### Freezing Magic
At 18th level, your wintry magic becomes extremely cold and
debilitating. When a creature fails a saving throw against
one of your spells that deals cold damage, it automatically
suffers the effects of the slow spell until the beginning of
your next turn.

Similarly, when you hit a creature with a spell that
deals cold damage, that creature must make a
constitution saving throw against your spell
save DC. On a failure, the creature
experiences the same slowing
effects until the beginning of
your next turn.

## Barbarian Path: Path of the Battlerager
Followers of the three dwarf gods of war, battleragers are
fearless warriors that specialize in the use of spiked armor,
allowing them to use their very bodies as weapons. Faith, fury
and their esoteric fighting style come together to make
battleragers a terrifying force to be reckoned with, one that
has been the vanguard of many great dwarven victories.

The deity a battlerager worships often influences their
attitude. Followers of Haela Brightaxe display the carefree
recklessness that has come to represent these warriors in the
eyes of other races. Ardents of Clangeddin Silverbeard are
honorable and valorous, and many an Underdark scout has
been thankful for the vigilance shown by a devotee of Gorm
Gulthyn.

#### Restriction: Followers of the Dwarven Pantheon Only
Dwarves are the main followers of the Path of the Battlerager,
as they fulfill a particular niche in dwarven society and
culture. Rarely, members of other races who worship the
Mordinsamman also take up this path.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign.
The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not
apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the
Realm

### Battlerager Armor
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
construct spiked armor and use it as a weapon. During a long
rest, you can create spiked armor using a set of light or
medium armor and 10 gp worth of iron or steel. The armor
retains all its original properties, except it allows you to use
any features that reference spiked armor.

While wearing spiked armor, you can use your armor spikes
as a melee weapon you're proficient in that deals 1d4 piercing
damage. You use your Strength modifier for attack and
damage rolls. When you rage while wearing spiked armor, and
as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can make one
weapon attack with your armor spikes.

Additionally, when you successfully grapple a creature and
are wearing spiked armour, the creature takes piercing
damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier

### Furious Strikes
At 6th level, your faith and fury overcome the most resilient of
foes. While raging, your armor spike attacks, and damage you
deal with your Battlerager features, counts as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Reckless Abandon
Starting at 6th level, you gain a bonus to your rage hitpoints equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).

### Resolute Purpose
At 10th level, your dedication to battle hardens you against
cowardly traps and mundane dangers; no battlerager wishes
to die an ignoble death. You have advantage on saving throws
against fatigue, and you have resistance to damage dealt
by environmental hazards (such as a pool of acid, an
avalanche, or lava) or traps

### Spiked Retribution
Starting at 14th level, your mastery of spiked armor allows
you to retaliate against melee attackers with impunity. When a
creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the
attacker takes piercing damage equal to your Strength
modifier if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are
wearing spiked armor.

\page
## Monastic Tradition: Way of the Drunken Fist (revised)
The Way of the Drunken Fist teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken master’s erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.

A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.

### Alcoholic Dance
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with brewer's supplies if you don't already have it. You can take a sip of your brewer's supplies as a bonus action and gain temporary hit points equal your Wisdom modifier.

### Drunken Technique
At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your movement. Whenever you use your focus features.

- **Drunken Movement**. If you use at least 1 exertion on your turn your movement becomes very difficult to follow. You gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.

- **Drunken Stance**. When you make a reaction attacks you can automatically push your opponent 5 feet.

- **Drunken Fall**. When you have been attacked with a melee attack roll, as a reaction you can fall prone and rolling half your speed without taking opportunity attacks, and until the beginning of your next turn your enemies have no advantage in hitting you because you are prone.

### The Drunken Gods Style
Starting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

- **The Drunken God of the Jar**. Once per turn, when a creature misses or hits you with a melee attack roll, as a free action you can drink a sip of your brewer's supplies.

- **The Drunken God Limp**. When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

- **The Drunken God Seeing Double**. When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, as a reaction you can cause that attack to target one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you or the creature. Reroll the attack and use the new result.

### Fierce Drinker
Starting at 11th level, the properties of your brewer's supplies take on special effects on you; every time you drink you can choose to have one of these effects.

- **Drunkard's Luck**. You always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, as a free action you can drink and spend 1 exertion to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.

- **Drunkard's Constitution**. Every time you drink thanks to the ability "The Drunken God of the Jar" you can spend 1 exertion and choose to gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

- **A Drunkard's Breath**. Every time you drink thanks to the ability "The Drunken God of the Jar"  you spend 1 exertion choise to spit it on a creature within 5 feet of you, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes. Or you can choose to ignite the alcohol and deal 1 martial arts die plus your Wisdom modifier of fire damage.

### Intoxicated Frenzy
At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows your walking speed increases by another 10 feet and you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of four Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.

\page
## Monastic Tradition: <br> Way of the Four Elements
You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to
harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can
align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the
four elements to your will, using them as an extension
of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate
themselves to a single element, but others weave the
elements together.

Many adepts of this tradition tattoo their bodies with
representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined
as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants,
mountains, and cresting waves.

### Initiate of the Way
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn
how to manipulate the four elements in subtle ways.
You learn two of the following cantrips: control flames*,
gust*, mold earth*, or shape water*. You learn two
additional cantrips from this list at 6th level.

### Disciple of the Elements
At 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness
the power of the four elements. Some disciplines
require you to spend exertion points when you use them.
You learn two elemental disciplines of your choice,
which are detailed in the elemental disciplines sections
below. You learn two additional elemental disciplines of
your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you gain an adept level, you
can also replace one elemental discipline that you
already know with a different discipline.

**Casting Elemental Spells**. Some elemental
disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10
of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of
spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its
casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to
provide material components for it. When you cast a
spell with a discipline, it is cast at the spell’s lowest
level unless otherwise specified.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend
additional exertion to increase the level of an elemental
discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has
an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands
does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional
exertion you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level
monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning
hands, you can spend 2 exertion to cast it as a 2nd-level
spell (the discipline’s base cost of 1 exertion plus 1).
The maximum number of exertion (its base exertion
cost plus any additional points) that you can spend on
the spell is 2, unless a discipline specifies otherwise.
This maximum increases to 3 at 9th level, 4 at 13th
level, and 5 at 17th level

At level 6, you can use flurry of blows as a bonus action (costing the same exertion as usual) after using any of the disciplines granted by this tradition.

#### 3rd Level Elemental Disciplines
Starting at 3rd level, you can learn the following
disciplines:

**Become the Teapot**. You roll with the incoming energy,
attuning to element, becoming it. You can spend 1 exertion to cast absorb elements*.

**Effortless Step**. The air around you works in unison
with your movements, rising you up as you jump. Your
jump height and distance are doubled (quadrupled with
Step of the Wind) and you gain advantage on Strength
(Athletics) checks related to jumping.

**Enduring Mountain Stance**. Your body and mind
becomes as rigid and unyielding as the ground below
you. Your ki roots your feet into the ground and you
become immovable. When you use the Dodge action,
you cannot be moved, pushed, grappled, frightened, or
knocked prone against your will until the start of your
next turn, even if magically compelled to do so. You
must be standing on the ground to use this ability.

**Fangs of the Fire Snake**. Your arms and legs become
enveloped in roaring gouts of flame. When you make an
unarmed attack on your turn, you can choose to strike
out tendrils of flames which stretch out beyond your
normal reach. Your reach increases by 5 feet for that
attack, and it deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning
damage. If the attack hits you can spend 1 exertion to
deal an extra 1d10 fire damage.

**Fang of the Frost Wolf**. You summon a shard of razor-
sharp ice and fling it at your foe. You can spend 1 exertion to cast ice knife*.

**Fist of Four Thunders**. You slam your fists together
in front of you, causing a thunderous boom that blows
away everything around you. You can spend 1 exertion
to cast thunderwave.

**Fist of Unbroken Air**. You summon a swirling wind
and concentrate it around your fist. When you make an
unarmed attack on your turn, you can choose to strike
out condensed bursts of air which stretch out beyond
your normal reach. Your reach increases by 10 feet for
that attack. If the attack hits you can spend 1 exertion to
force the target to make a Strength saving throw or be
pushed back 10 feet and be knocked prone.

**Golden Snake’s Icy Path**. Whenever you take
the Dash action, until the end of your turn for any
movement you make along a surface you can leave a
trail of slippery ice. This ice counts as difficult terrain
and lasts until the start of your next turn.

tremor that knocks over your foes. You can spend 1 exertion to cast earth tremor*.

gesture, you summon forth a barrage of hot cinders.

1 exertion as a bonus action to create a whip of water
that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A
creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your
Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier, plus an extra
1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional exertion
you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it
up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t pull
it or knock it prone. You can’t use Water Whip and cast
a spell during the same turn.

#### 6th Level Elemental Disciplines
Starting at 6th level, you can learn the following
disciplines:

**A Leaf on the Wind**. A powerful wind rises up to
catch you as you fall. Your Slow Fall ability no longer
requires a reaction to use, and instead you may use

a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active,
and then collapses.

**Red Dragon’s Claws**. Rays of fire spring from your
outstretched hand to sear your foes. You can spend 2 exertion to cast scorching ray.

**Swarming Ice Rabbit**. A flurry of magic snowballs
erupts from a point you choose within range. You can
spend 2 exertion to cast snilloc’s snowball swarm*.

**Water Jet**. You can spend 2 exertion as an action
to unleash a jet of water in a line that is 30 feet
long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must
make a Strength saving throw, taking bludgeoning
damage equal to your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom
modifier on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. In addition, you can move each target
that fails its saving throw to any unoccupied space
touching the line.

#### 11th Level Elemental Disciplines
Starting at 11th level, you can learn the following
disciplines:

**Dance of Three Ways**. You summon six spheres of
earth from the ground, suspend them in the air around
you, and ignite them with your fiery ki. With a thought,
you launch these blazing meteors at your foe. You can
spend 3 exertion to cast melf’s minute meteors*.

**Earth Reaches for Sky**. Focusing your strength with

causing an eruption of churned earth and stone that

stone, nearly impervious to weapons. You can spend 4

\page

can spend 3 exertion to cast wall of water*.

#### 17th Level Elemental Disciplines
Starting at 17th level, you can learn the following
disciplines:

**Avatar of the Elements**. As an ultimate display of
your mastery of the elements, you can spend 5 exertion as an
action to have the elements of earth, fire, air, and water
form a protective sphere around your body, gaining
multiple benefits for 1 minute. While this ability is
active, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
slashing, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.
You also gain a burrow, fly, and swim speed equal to
your movement speed. Lastly, you can use any of the
following abilities as a bonus action:
- You create a small earthquake on the ground in a
15-foot radius around you. Each creature in that area
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked
prone.
- You create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide
extending from you in a direction you choose. Each
creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
- You create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered
on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each
creature in that area must make a Constitution saving
throw. A creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that
creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the
center of the cube.
- You create a 15-foot cone of ice shards extending
from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose.
Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution

## Way of the Kensei (revised)
Adepts of the Way of the Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword-fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.

A kensei sees a weapon much in the same way a calligrapher or a painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the Kensei views it as a tool to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice and study.

### Path of the Kensei
When you choose this tradition 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits:

**Kensei Weapon Arts.** You gain proficiency with martial wepons, and any martial weapon that lacks the special or heavy properties becomes an adept weapon for you, as well as the glaive and longbow (though these may be known to you by other names, such as guandao or naginata and daikyu). These weapons lose the heavy property when you use them as adept weapons. When an adept feature would require an unarmed strike, you can substitute a melee weapon attack, but the weapon's normal damage is replaced by a roll of your Martial Arts die.

**Agile Parry.** When you are hit with an attack while holding an adept weapon that lacks the reach trait, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack, potentially turning it into a miss. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus

**Kensei Shot.** You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an adept weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an adept weapon takes extra damage equal to your Martial Arts die. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

**Way of the Brush** You gain proficiency with your choice of Calligrapher's Supplies or Painter's Supplies

### Empowered Weapons
At 6th level, you extend your focus into your adept weapons. Your attacks with your adept weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### One with the Blade
At 6th level you gain the following benefits:

**Deft Strike.** When you hit a target with an adept weapon, you can spend up to 3 exertion to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target. The bonus is equal to your Martial Arts die times the exertion spent. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

**Stunning Shot** You can use your Stunning Strike feature when you make a ranged weapon attack with an adept weapon, for the cost of 1 additional exertion

You cannot make use of both benefits on the same turn

### Sharpen the Blade
At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your focus. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 exertion to grant one adept weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of exertion you spent. If the weapon was already a magic weapon with a bonus to attack and damage rolls, you cannot increase the total bonus beyond +3.

This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

### Unerring Accuracy
At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using an adept weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
\page
## Way Of The Sun Soul (Revised)

### Radiant Sun Bolt
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range equal to your movement speed. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Adept table.

When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 exertion to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.

When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.

<div class='descriptive'>

##### Changes made and why?
Changed the range from a static 30ft to matching movement speed to solve the complaint of "why use range when I can just run up to them punch and run away at higher levels."
</div>

### Searing Arc Flare
At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your exertion into bright waves of energy. 

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 exertion to produce a blinding flash of light in a 15 ft cone in front of you. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not blinded on a successful one.

You can spend additional exertion to make a stronger blast. Each additional exertion you spend increases the damage by 1d6 and range by 5ft. The maximum number of exertion (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your Adept level.

<div style='margin-top:0px'></div>

<div class='descriptive'>

##### Changes made and why?
Instead of just casting burning hands, this attack does the same amount of damage but in radiant as to keep consistency with the rest of the subclass, the blinding aspect was to make up for the fact that the Monk's stunning strike (which costs half the amount of ki) gets underused with this subclass and to make up for the fact that once again punching and running away would otherwise be more effective. Additionally by making the effect last until the START of your next turn, this allows a pseudo-support ability.
</div>

### Searing Sunburst
At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.

You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.
<div class='descriptive'>

##### Changes made and why?
Nothing, this move already rocks and has a reasonable cost
</div>

### Sun Shield and Undying Resolve
At 17th level, you're able to wreath yourself in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.

Additionally, if your hitpoints are reduced to 0, or you are required to make a death saving throw, instead, if you wish, you may choose to regain consciousness and stand up if prone. You then regain half your maximum hitpoints and gain the effects of the haste spell, without the resulting lethargy. If this ability is activated it can't be used again until you've completed a long rest.

<div class='descriptive'>

##### Changes made and why?
Kept the glowing effects for the sake of flavour more than anything, but the entirety of the ability is redone, taking some inspiration from the celestial warlock's level 15 ability.

The choice of returning with a burst of strength also references DBZ as whenever a Saiyan takes damage, they get stronger once they heal.
</div>

## Warlock Patron: The Undying (Revised)
Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize—like all power—comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus.

In the Realms, Undying patrons include Larloch the Shadow King, legendary master of Warlock's Crypt, and Gilgeam, the God-King of Unther.

### Expanded Spell List
The Undying lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
##### The Undying Expanded Spells
| Warlock Level |Spells | 
|:-------------:|:-----:|
| 1st           | False Life, Ray of Sickness|
| 3rd           | Blindness/Deafness, Silence|
| 5th           | Bestow Curse, Speak with Dead|
| 7th           | Aura of Life, Death Ward|
| 9th           | Contagion, Legend Lore|

### Defy Death
Starting at 1st level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Corpse Puppeteer
When you reach 6th level in this class, you gain the ability to control the dead.

As an action, you can turn a pile of bones or a corpse of a Small or Medium humanoid within 10 feet of you into a skeleton (if you chose bones) or a zombie (if you chose a corpse). The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your Warlock level, and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.

You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creature you made with this feature, provided that creature is within 60 feet of you. If you have created multiple creatures using this feature, you can issue the same command to any or all of them using a single bonus action, provided each creature you issue the command to is within range. You can command the creature to do something specific, such as move to a specific location and / or take a specific action, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

A creature created using this feature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must use this feature on the creature again before the 24 hours ends.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your half your Warlock level (rounded down), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Undying Nature
By the time you reach 10th level in this class, your body has become resistant to the weaknesses of mortal flesh. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You are immune to disease.
- For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

### Immune to the Grave
By the time you reach 14th level in this class, you are so accustomed to walking the line between life and death that it is almost impossible for you to be forced across that line unwillingly. You have advantage on death saving throws, and cannot be killed instantly by massive damage.

Additionally, if you die, you can choose to come back to life. You can cast the raise dead spell on yourself from beyond the grave, requiring no components. Once you come back to life this way, you cannot do so again for 14 days.

#### Bind Demesne
*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
**Classes** :: Keeper
**Casting Time** :: 24 hours
**Range** :: Touch
**Components** :: V, S, M (herbs and incense worth at least
1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration** :: Instantaneous
This ancient ritual was taught to the first keepers, and binds
you to a place. As part of casting the spell, you claim an area,
which can be as small as a room or as large as a fortress, but
can be no larger than 500 feet on a side.

When you begin casting this spell, each creature within 1
mile of you with an Intelligence score of 6 or greater becomes
aware of your claim and the effects of the spell. If you manage
to finish the ritual, you make the area your demesne.

Within your demesne, you can shape reality to your will.
You can spend 1 minute transforming an area you can see in
your demesne no larger than a 20-foot cube, destroying solid
structures, raising or depressing land, changing the weather
and temperature, creating sounds and smells, or altering the
material of a structure or surface—such as transforming dirt
into stone, wood, ice, or flesh. You can heavily obscure areas
with fog. Materials you create using your demesne disappear
if removed from it, and food you create nourishes only you.

If you create or summon a creature with a spell within your
demesne and it obeys your commands, you can bind it to your
demesne until you bind another summoned creature this way.
If you do, the spell doesn't require concentration, and instead
lasts until dispelled or until the creature leaves the demesne.

After casting this spell, you can't cast it again unless your
demesne is destroyed or you willingly sever your bond to it. If
you lose your demesne, you take a -7 penalty to ability checks,
reduced by 1 each time you finish a long rest. Your bond ends
if you die and aren't resurrected within 7 days. Your demesne
can't be claimed by other spellcasters while the bond lasts.

#### Bind Implement
*2nd-level transmutation (ritual)*
**Classes** :: Keeper
**Casting Time** :: 24 hours
**Range** :: Touch
**Components** :: V, S, M (herbs and incense worth at least
100 gp, which the spell consumes, and an item small and
light enough for you to carry in one or both hands)
**Duration** :: Instantaneous
This ancient ritual was taught to the first keepers, and binds
you to an item. A spellcaster's implement says a lot about the
persona they project to the world; a spellcaster who makes a
weapon their implement is always ready for violence, while a
standard suggests devotion to a cause or movement.

You can use your bound implement as a spellcasting focus
for spells you cast, and if you finish a short or long rest and it
isn't on your person, you can have it reappear in your hands.

You can't have more than one implement bonded by this
spell at a time. Your bond with the implement is broken if you
die, if it's destroyed, or if you cast this spell again.
While on your person, your implement gives you additional
benefits based on the type of object it is:

**Arm**. If your implement is a weapon, staff, chain, or similar
object, you can't be disarmed of it while you're conscious.

**Icon**. If your implement is a talisman, emblem, ring, or
similar object, you can use it as a spellcasting focus without
holding it in hand as long as you wear it visibly.

**Tool**. If your implement is a tool you're proficient with, your
proficiency bonus is doubled for checks you make with it.

**Trinket**. If your implement is a personal treasure, skull,
coin, lamp, or similar, you stablise if you start your turn dying.

**Vessel**. If your implement is a chalice, chest, goblet, or
similar, you gain temporary hit points when you finish a short
or long rest equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Other**. At the DM's option, an implement not listed above
might give you an alternative benefit, but it should be no more
powerful than those described above.

#### Blade Step
*2nd-level transmutation*

**Classes** :: Ranger, Warlock, Wizard
**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Self(30-foot line)
**Components:**   :: S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You dash with impossible speed in line up to 30
feet long in a direction you choose. Each creature
in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 damage or half
as much damage on a successful one. The damage
type is the same as the weapon used in the casting.

You end this movement the nearest unoccupied
space at the end of the line. If you end it in the air,
you fall if nothing is holding you aloft.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the length of the
line increases by 30 feet and the damage increases
by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

\page

#### Elemental Blessing
*Conjuration cantrip*

**Classes** :: Druid, Keeper
**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30-feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 round

You beckon elemental spirits to infuse a creature. Choose an
area of air, earth, fire, or water, and a willing creature you can
see within range. Spirits kin to the area you choose infuse the
target creature. For example, flame spirits could erupt from a
torch, and water spirits could emerge from a waterskin.

The next time the infused target hits with an attack before
your next turn, the attack deals an extra 1d8 damage to the
target. The damage type is bludgeoning (earth), cold (water),
fire (fire), or lightning (air).

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th
level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Guise
*2nd-level transmutation (ritual)*
**Classes** :: Druid, Keeper, Warlock, Wizard
**Casting Time** :: 1 minute
**Range** :: Touch
**Components** :: V, S
**Duration** :: 8 hours
You touch a Large or smaller willing creature and grant it the
guise of a Small or smaller beast you choose for the duration.
This spell has no effect on humanoids or beasts.

Any equipment the creature has is absorbed or borne by its
new form (its choice). While disguised, the creature's size and
speed are replaced by its new form's. The creature's statistics
are otherwise unchanged. This new appearance resembles its
true self in some way. For example, a unicorn could become a
horse, and a dragon could take the form of a small lizard.

The spell ends early if the creature uses its action to end it.
It also ends early if the creature attacks, casts a spell, or uses
a magical ability, or if you use an action to dismiss it

#### Practitioner's Rites
*1st-level conjuration (ritual)* 

**Classes** :: Keeper
**Casting Time** :: 10 minutes
**Range** :: Touch
**Components** :: V, S, M (Chalk and a handful of edible food, which the spell consumes)
**Duration** :: Instantaneous

You entreat a boon from nearby spirits. When you cast the
spell, choose one of the following rites, the target of which
must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting.

**Elegy**. You speak the name of a dead creature, and imbue
an object or creature precious to it in life, such as a treasured
belonging or a loved one, with sweet nostalgia. If the creature
became an undead with unfinished business, such as a ghost
or poltergeist, and is within 1 mile of you, it must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or spend its turns moving as close to
the target as it can for 1 hour or until it takes damage.

**Fertility**. A willing creature you touch is imbued with life.
Any attempts the affected creature makes to conceive a child
within the next 24 hours become successful. If the creature is
pregnant, the pregnancy can't fail for the next month, and any
disease affecting the creature will not harm their offspring.

**Sanctuary**. A nonmagical, unintelligent animal—including
most beasts and some monstrosities (at the DM's discretion)
—is shepherded by gentle spirits. Until the target finds a safe
habitat, it is led to the nearest sources of food, water, and any
place it can rest, and away from hunters and trappers.

**Warding**. A building is protected by spirits until you leave
or you fall unconscious. As part of casting the spell, you touch
a number of thresholds, such as doors or windows. While the
protection lasts, each threshold has resistance to all damage.
A celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead attempting to enter
must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it can't
can't willingly enter the building this turn.

#### Shamanic Command
*Transmutation cantrip*

**Classes** :: Keeper
**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

Choose a summoned creature within range that obeys your
commands, such as a spirit summoned by the summon beast
spell. If the target can hear you, it can Attack (one attack only),
Hide, or move up to its speed using its reaction.

#### Spirit Dive
*1st-level conjuration*
**Classes** :: Keeper, Warlock, Wizard
**Casting Time** :: 1 action
**Range** :: 60 feet
**Components** :: V, S
**Duration** :: Instantaneous
You briefly empower a summoned creature within range that
obeys your commands, such as a spirit summoned by the find
familiar spell. If it can hear you, the target can use its reaction
to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

Each creature other than the target within 10 feet of the
space it appears in must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
or take 2d8 force damage.

\page

#### Spirit Flood
*3rd-level evocation*
**Classes** :: Druid, Keeper
**Casting Time** :: 1 action
**Range** :: Self (5-foot radius)
**Components** :: V, S
**Duration** :: Instantaneous
Whirling spirits surround you, lashing out at your enemies.
Each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet
of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes
3d12 force damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.

As part of casting the spell, you can cause the spirits to
surround a summoned creature you can see within 60 feet of
you that obeys your commands. Each creature of your choice
that you can see within 10 feet of the target must also make a
saving throw against the spell. A creature in both areas is only
affected by the spell once.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for
each slot level above 4th.

#### Vengeful Spirits
*4th-level evocation*
**Classes** :: Keeper
**Casting Time** :: 1 action
**Range** :: 60 feet
**Components** :: V, S, M (a dead creature's beloved possession)
**Duration** :: Instantaneous
Vengeful spirits briefly inhabit up to five other creatures you
can see within range. Each of the targets can use its reaction
to Attack (one weapon attack only), Cast a Spell (cantrip only),
or move up to its speed. Each creature that attacks or targets
another creature with a harmful spell must target the nearest
hostile creature that they can see with the attack or spell.
**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, the vengeful spirits can inhabit one
additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
