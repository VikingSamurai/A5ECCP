# Introduction
Herein are algorithmic instructions and notes for arriving at conversions of classes that I have brought over to A5E, but cannot share directly for fear of accidentally violating people's intellectual property.

This document will necessarily be shorter than the Community Class Conversion Project document because it assumes that you already have the class material from the sources that sell them. There are links detailing where to find and purchase each of the classes in the credits section of this document.

Also be aware that without the content these authors have made, conversions like this obviously would not be possible, so be sure to show them your support by picking up their stuff.

\page
## Dancer
### Class Modifications
- Culture is now a Dancer class skill.

### Progression Modifications
- Grant Bard's Knack progression
- {First Level 1 feature} change: Now gives an expertise die to all checks and attacks made before the end of the target's turn, as opposed to what it did before.
- Remove the first level 2 feature, the second level 3 feature, the level 5 feature, the level 7, 14 and 18 features.
- Move level 18 feature to level 15
- Grant 'Combat Tactic' at level 1
	- **Combat Tactic**: Choose 1
		- **Capoeirista**: Any time you move 25ft or more in a straight line and then attack, the first attack the creature affected makes against you is made with disadvantage, as they are unable to keep up with the sudden change in momentum
		- **Tamer**:	whips have a damage die of 1d8 for you

	- Grant Proficiency in 2 Traditions from: Mirror's Glint, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current and Razor's Edge
	- Grant Maneuver Pool of PB at level 2
	- Grant Rogue's Maneuver Progression
- Grant 'Dancer's Grace' at level 3
	- **Dancer's Grace**: Choose 1
		- **Interpretive dance**: You gain an expertise die in culture. If you do not share a language with someone, you can make a culture check to communicate in very general "terms" with them, over and above what you could communicate without this feature.
		- **{former Second level 3 feature}**: As before, but now additionally gives an expertise die in performance
		- **Social Expertise**: expertise die to  Insight, Persuasion, Deception, or Sleight of Hand.

			- Elaboration: In any situation (where it makes sense), a PC can declare “I know a guy,” and then quickly sketch that NPC & the relationship. Fewer details are usually better - that leaves room for the DM & PCs to play.
		- **Social Expertise**: expertise die on Insight, Performance, Deception, Persuasion or Sleight of Hand
- Change feature at level 13 such that
	- **{level 13 feature}**: Choose one:

- Grant Subtle Moves at level 14:
	- **Subtle Moves**: Choose one
		- **Hidden Signs** - As with feature of same name from Rogue's Guarded Aspect
		- **Seen it All** - As with feature of same name from Rogue's Guarded Aspect

		- **Roguish Charm**: As with Rogue feature of same name
